0,hr26,"To amend chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, to provide that major rules of the executive branch shall have no force or effect unless a joint resolution of approval is enacted into law.","Regulations From the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2017  (Sec. 2) This bill states that its purpose is to increase accountability for and transparency in the federal regulatory process by requiring Congress to approve all new major regulations.  (Sec. 3) The bill revises provisions relating to congressional review of agency rulemaking to require federal agencies promulgating rules to: (1) identify and repeal or amend existing rules to completely offset any annual costs of new rules to the U.S. economy; and (2) publish information about the rules in the Federal Register and include in their reports to Congress and to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) a classification of the rules as major or nonmajor rules and a complete copy of the cost-benefit analysis of the rules, including an analysis of any jobs added or lost, differentiating between public and private sector jobs. A ""major rule"" is any rule that the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of the Office of Management and Budget finds has resulted in or is likely to result in: (1) an annual cost on the economy of $100 million or more (adjusted annually for inflation); (2) a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, federal, state, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or (3) significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or the ability of U.S.-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises.  A joint resolution of approval of major rules must be enacted before such rules may take effect (currently, major rules take effect unless a joint resolution disapproving them is enacted). If a joint resolution of approval is not enacted by the end of 70 session days or legislative days, as applicable, after the agency proposing the rule submits its report on such rule to Congress, the major rule shall be deemed not to be approved and shall not take effect. The bill permits a major rule to take effect for one 90-calendar day period without such approval if the President determines it is necessary because of an imminent threat to health or safety or other emergency, for the enforcement of criminal laws, for national security, or to implement an international trade agreement. The bill sets forth the congressional approval procedure for major rules and the congressional disapproval procedure for nonmajor rules. Agencies are prohibited from allowing a major rule to take effect without the congressional review procedures set forth in this bill.  A joint resolution addressing a report classifying a rule must be introduced as a major rule within three legislative days in the House of Representative and three session days in the Senate. The bill: (1) prohibits any amendments to such a joint resolution at any stage of the legislative process; (2) provides for expedited consideration of a joint resolution of approval; and (3) requires a vote on such resolution in the Senate within 15 session days after it is reported by the committee to which it was referred, or after such committee has been discharged from further consideration of the resolution. A court may review whether an agency has completed the necessary requirements under this bill for a rule to take effect (currently, no judicial review of a determination, finding, action, or omission in the rulemaking process is subject to judicial review). The bill limits the effect of a joint resolution of approval of a major rule. The bill is inapplicable to rules that concern monetary policy proposed or implemented by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee.  Any rule promulgated by a federal agency that relates to a regulatory program for a commercial, recreational, or subsistence activity related to hunting, fishing, or camping, or any rule other than a major rule for which an agency for good cause finds that notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest, shall take effect at such time as the agency determines.  Before new rules take effect, agencies must amend or repeal other rules to offset any annual costs of the new rules to the U.S. economy. Over a 10-year period, agencies must submit reports designating for congressional review all agency rules that are in effect as of one year after enactment of this bill. If Congress does not enact a joint resolution of approval for such rules, the rules shall not continue in effect.  (Sec. 4) The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended to provide that any congressional approval procedure set forth in this bill affecting budget authority, outlays, or receipts shall be assumed to be effective unless it is not approved in accordance with this bill. (Sec. 5) The GAO must conduct a study to determine as of the date of enactment of this bill: (1) how many rules were in effect, (2) how many major rules were in effect, and (3) the total estimated economic cost imposed by all such rules. The GAO must report to Congress on such study within one year of the enactment of this bill.

1,sconres3,A concurrent resolution setting forth the congressional budget for the United States Government for fiscal year 2017 and setting forth the appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal years 2018 through 2026.,"(This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the Senate on January 12, 2017. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Highlights:  This concurrent resolution establishes the FY2017 congressional budget resolution, which provides a framework for congressional consideration of revenue, spending, and other budget-related legislation. The budget resolution is a nonbinding framework used by Congress and cannot be signed into law or vetoed by the President.  The resolution establishes budget enforcement procedures by setting forth rules for applying budget points of order to various legislative proposals. It also includes reconciliation instructions directing various congressional committees to submit to the congressional budget committees deficit reduction legislation, which Congress must then consider using expedited legislative procedures.  The resolution includes reserve funds that provide the chairmen of the congressional budget committees with flexibility in applying budget enforcement rules to health care legislation that meets specified criteria.  Full Summary:  Establishes the congressional budget for the federal government for FY2017 and sets forth budgetary levels for FY2018-FY2026.  TITLE I--RECOMMENDED LEVELS AND AMOUNTS  Subtitle A--Budgetary Levels in Both Houses  (Sec. 1101) Recommends levels and amounts for FY2017-FY2026 for:    federal revenues,   new budget authority,   budget outlays,   deficits,   public debt, and   debt held by the public.   (Sec. 1102) Recommends levels of new budget authority and outlays for FY2017-FY2026 for each major functional category, including:    National Defense;   International Affairs;   General Science, Space, and Technology;   Energy;   Natural Resources and Environment;   Agriculture;   Commerce and Housing Credit;   Transportation;   Community and Regional Development;   Education, Training, Employment, and Social Services;   Health;   Medicare;   Income Security;   Social Security;   Veterans Benefits and Services;   Administration of Justice;   General Government;   Net Interest;   Allowances; and   Undistributed Offsetting Receipts.   Subtitle B--Levels and Amounts in the Senate  (Sec. 1201) Recommends Senate levels for FY2017-FY2026 for Social Security revenues, outlays, and administrative expenses.  (Sec. 1202) Recommends Senate levels of new budget authority and outlays for FY2017-FY2026 for U.S. Postal Service discretionary administrative expenses.  TITLE II--RECONCILIATION  (Title II includes reconciliation instructions directing congressional committees to submit deficit reduction legislation to the budget committees. Under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, reconciliation bills are considered by Congress using expedited legislative procedures that prevent a filibuster and restrict amendments in the Senate.)  (Sec. 2001) Includes reconciliation instructions directing the Senate Finance Committee and the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee to each submit to the Senate Budget Committee legislation to reduce the deficit by at least $1 billion over the FY2017-FY2026 period. Requires the legislation to be submitted by January 27, 2017.  (Sec. 2002) Includes reconciliation instructions directing the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee to each submit to the House Budget Committee legislation to reduce the deficit by at least $1 billion over the FY2017-FY2026 period. Requires the legislation to be submitted by January 27, 2017.  TITLE III--RESERVE FUNDS  Establishes reserve funds that provide the chairmen of the congressional budget committees with flexibility in applying budget enforcement rules to health care legislation that meets specified criteria. (Under the reserve funds, the chairmen may revise committee allocations, aggregates and other appropriate levels in this resolution, and the pay-as-you-go [PAYGO] ledger in the Senate.)  (Sec. 3001) Establishes a deficit-neutral reserve fund for health care legislation that would not increase the deficit over the FY2017-FY2016 period.  (Sec. 3002) Establishes a reserve fund for health care legislation. Specifies that the adjustments permitted under this section may not exceed the difference obtained from subtracting $2 billion from the sum of deficit reduction over the period of the total of fiscal years FY2017-FY2026 achieved under legislation for which the chairman has exercised authority under the deficit-neutral reserve fund in section 3001.  Specifies that, in the House and the Senate, legislation for which the chairman of the applicable budget committee has exercised authority pursuant to this section is exempt from: (1) the point of order against legislation increasing the short-term deficit, and (2) the point of order against legislation increasing long-term deficits or direct spending.  (The short-term deficit point of order prohibits the Senate from considering legislation that would cause a net increase in the deficit in excess of $10 billion in any fiscal year provided for in the most recently adopted budget resolution unless it is fully offset over the period of all fiscal years provided for in the most recently adopted budget resolution.  The long-term point of order applies to legislation that would cause a net-increase in on budget-deficits in the Senate or a net increase in direct spending in the House in excess of $5 billion in any of the 4 consecutive 10-year periods beginning with the first fiscal year that is 10 years after the budget year provided for in the most recently adopted budget resolution.)  TITLE IV-OTHER MATTERS  (Sec. 4001) Provides that, for the purposes of enforcing the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the chairmen of the congressional budget committees may submit for publication in the Congressional Record allocations that are normally included in the joint statement of managers accompanying a conference report.  (Sec. 4002) Provides that the discretionary administrative expenses of the Social Security Administration and the U.S. Postal Service are reflected in the allocation to the appropriations committees to ensure that the committees retain control over the expenses through the annual appropriations process. Requires the administrative expenses to be included in the cost estimates for appropriations legislation for budget enforcement purposes.  (Sec. 4003) Sets forth procedures for adjustments of the allocations and aggregates included in the budget resolution. Specifies that legislation for which the House Budget Committee Chairman has made adjustments or revisions in the allocations, aggregates, and other budgetary levels of this concurrent resolution is exempt from: (1) the Cut-As-You-Go point of order, and (2) the point of order against legislation increasing long-term direct spending.  (The Cut-As-You-Go point of order prohibits the House from considering legislation that would have the net effect of increasing direct spending over specified time periods.  The long-term point of order prohibits the House from considering legislation that would cause a net increase in direct spending in excess of $5 billion in any of the 4 consecutive 10-year periods beginning with the first fiscal year that is 10 years after the budget year provided for in the most recently adopted budget resolution.  This provision effectively allows the House Budget Committee Chairman to exempt from the points of order health care legislation that qualifies for the reserve funds in title III.)  (Sec. 4004) Affirms that this budget resolution is adopted as an exercise of the rulemaking powers of the House and Senate and that either chamber has the constitutional right to change these rules.

No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of 2017 TITLE I--PROHIBITING FEDERALLY FUNDED ABORTIONS (Sec. 101) This bill makes permanent the prohibition on the use of federal funds, including funds in the budget of the District of Columbia, for abortion or health coverage that includes abortion. The prohibitions in this bill, and current prohibitions, do not apply to abortions in cases of rape or incest, or where a physical condition endangers a woman's life unless an abortion is performed. Abortions may not be provided in a federal health care facility or by a federal employee. TITLE II--APPLICATION UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT (Sec. 201) This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to prohibit qualified health plans from including coverage for abortions. (Qualified health plans are sold on health insurance exchanges, are the only plans eligible for premium subsidies and small employer health insurance tax credits, and fulfill an individual's requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage.) Currently, qualified health plans may cover abortion, but the portion of the premium attributable to abortion coverage is not eligible for subsidies.

The commission shall give priority to the review of rules or sets of rules that are major rules or that include major rules, that have been in effect more than 15 years, that impose paperwork burdens or unfunded mandates that could be reduced substantially without significantly diminishing regulatory effectiveness, that impose disproportionately high costs on small entities, or that could be strengthened in their effectiveness while reducing regulatory costs. The commission's goal is to achieve a reduction of at least 15% in the cumulative costs of regulation with a minimal reduction in the overall effectiveness of such regulation.  Criteria the commission shall use in identifying which rules and sets of rules should be repealed include whether:    the original purpose of the rules was achieved;  the implementation, compliance, administration, enforcement, imposition of unfunded mandates, or other costs of the rules are not justified by a cost-benefit analysis;  the rules have been rendered unnecessary or obsolete;  the rules are ineffective at achieving their purposes;  the rules overlap, duplicate, or conflict with other federal, state, or local rules;  the rules have excessive compliance costs, impose unfunded mandates, or are otherwise excessively burdensome compared to possible alternatives;  the rules inhibit innovation or harm competition;  the rules limit or prevent an agency from applying new or emerging technologies to improve efficiency and effectiveness of government;  the rules harm wage growth, including wage growth for minimum wage and part-time workers; the agency complied with Congressional Review Act requirements to submit the rules to Congress and the Government Accountability Office before the rules take effect; and a repeal would impact public health.  The commission shall terminate on the later of five years and 180 days after the enactment of this bill or five years after the date by which the terms of all members of the commission have commenced. The bill requires congressional consideration and enactment of a joint resolution of approval of recommendations of the commission for the repeal of a rule or rules prior to agency implementation of a repeal. An agency is prohibited from: (1) reissuing rules substantially similar to rules repealed by this bill without congressional approval, or (2) issuing a new rule that results in the same adverse effects of a repealed rule.   The commission shall establish a public website to provide information in a standard data format and shall receive and publish public comments at no cost to the public. The Federal Advisory Committee Act shall apply to the commission.  TITLE II--REGULATORY CUT-GO (Sec. 201) This title requires agencies, when making a new rule, to repeal rules or sets of rules classified by the commission as recommended for repeal to offset the costs of the new rule (cut-go procedure).  (Sec. 202) Agencies are exempted from cut-go requirements when the commission has implemented the repeal of all rules and sets of rules that the commission has recommended for repeal.  (Sec. 203) The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) of the Office of Management and Budget shall review and certify the accuracy of agency determinations of the cost of new rules subject to cut-go requirements.  TITLE III--RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW OF NEW RULES (Sec. 301) This title requires an agency, when issuing a new rule, to include a plan for the review of such rule not later than 10 years after the date of such rule.  TITLE IV--JUDICIAL REVIEW  (Sec. 401) This title allows judicial review of repeals of regulations, cut-go procedures, and plans for future review.  TITLE V--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS (Sec. 501) A ""major rule"" is defined to mean any rule that OIRA determines is likely to impose: (1) an annual cost on the economy of $100 million or more, adjusted annually for inflation; (2) a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, federal, state, local, or tribal government agencies, or geographic regions; (3) significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or the ability of U.S.-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises; or (4) significant impacts on multiple sectors of the economy.

17,hr1009,"To amend title 44, United States Code, to require the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs to review regulations, and for other purposes.","OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability Act  (Sec. 2) This bill codifies and revises the centralized regulatory review process, currently required under executive order, to require the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within the Office of Management and Budget to: (1) chair the Regulatory Working Group that assists agencies with regulatory issues, (2) publish a unified agenda of each agency's regulations that are under development or review, and (3) review each agency's significant regulatory actions. OIRA's review is expanded to include the significant regulatory actions of independent regulatory agencies. Excluded from OIRA's review are: (1) the Government Accountability Office, (2) the Federal Election Commission, (3) the governments of the District of Columbia and of the territories and possessions of the United States, and (4) government-owned contractor-operated facilities. Under the bill, a ""significant regulatory action"" is any substantive regulatory action normally published in the Federal Register that promulgates or is expected to lead to the promulgation of a final regulation (including notices of inquiry, advance notices of proposed rulemaking, and notices of proposed rulemaking), or any statement of general applicability and future effect that sets policy on or interprets a statutory, regulatory, or technical issue, that may:  have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;   adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or state, local, or tribal governments or communities;  create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;  materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients therein; or  raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates.  The Regulatory Working Group shall consist of OIRA, agencies that have significant domestic regulatory responsibility, and other executive branch officials. The group must identify methods to ensure agencies coordinate with state, local, and tribal governments.  Agencies must submit annually to OIRA a regulatory plan with:   a summary of the legal basis, need, alternatives, and schedule for each significant regulatory action they expect to issue;   an employee the public may contact for additional information about each action;  the agency's plan to coordinate with state, local, and tribal governments throughout the regulatory process; a description of any action taken to ensure that planned significant regulatory actions are not duplicative or conflicting with any other existing or planned regulatory action; a retrospective review of existing regulations that are unjustified, unnecessary, duplicative, inappropriately burdensome, or otherwise recommended for removal; and  a description of any other agency program to review existing regulations.   OIRA must circulate an agency's regulatory plans to any other agency that may be affected by the plans. The other agencies must notify OIRA if a regulatory action conflicts with their own policies or actions, and OIRA must notify the relevant agencies of any conflicts.  To identify regulations that are no longer justified or that affect a particular group, industry, or economy sector, OIRA must: (1) work with interested entities and agencies; (2) meet with state, local, and tribal governments; and (3) convene conferences with businesses, nongovernmental organizations, and the public.   By March 15 and September 15 of each year, OIRA must publish the unified agenda of each agency's regulations under development or review. OIRA must: (1) issue guidance for agencies on the manner of submission of regulations for publication in the unified agenda, (2) provide a standard definition for each stage of review to assist the public in understanding the different terms used by agencies, and (3) review agency compliance. The unified agenda must explain why any regulation included in the immediately previous agenda is no longer included.  OIRA must conduct a government-wide review of significant regulatory actions to ensure consistency with applicable law and avoid conflict with policy or action taken or planned by another agency. Each agency must provide OIRA with a list of each planned regulatory action with an identification of whether each such regulatory action is significant. OIRA shall determine whether submitted regulatory actions are significant and must review each such significant regulatory action. Agencies may consult with OIRA at any time. OIRA must maintain a log of each agency consultation before submitting a significant regulatory action for review. Before issuing a significant regulatory action, an agency must submit to OIRA for review: (1) a description of the need for the action and how the action will meet such need; (2) an assessment of the costs and benefits; (3) an explanation of the manner in which the significant regulatory action is consistent with a statutory mandate and avoids undue interference with state, local, and tribal government functions; and (4) an explanation of agency efforts to coordinate with state, local, and tribal governments. For economically significant regulatory actions, the agency must also submit any assessments developed during the decision-making process that quantify the costs and benefits of the regulatory action versus feasible alternatives and explain why the planned regulatory action is preferable to potential alternatives.  OIRA's deadline to complete a review after an agency's submission of a regulation is: (1) 10 days for a notice of inquiry, advance notice of proposed rulemaking, or other preliminary regulatory action prior to a notice of proposed rulemaking; (2) 90 days for any other significant regulatory action that is not preliminary; or (3) 45 days if OIRA has previously reviewed a regulatory action that was not preliminary and there has been no material change in the facts and circumstances.  OIRA's review period may be extended for any number of additional 30-day periods upon mutual agreement of OIRA and the agency. For each extension, OIRA shall make publicly available online a written explanation and an estimate of the expected conclusion date. If OIRA is unable to conclude a review before the deadline, it may return the draft of the regulatory action to the agency with an explanation of why the review could not be completed and what additional information, resources, or time OIRA would need to complete the review. An agency may withdraw the regulatory action from OIRA review at any time prior its completion. OIRA's review of significant regulatory actions must determine the extent to which the agency:   identified and assessed the significance of the problem the regulation is designed to address; examined whether to modify any existing regulations or laws that create or contribute to the problem;  assessed alternatives to direct regulation, including economic incentives to encourage desired behaviors; considered risks, costs and benefits, enforcement and compliance, incentives for innovation, consistency, predictability, flexibility, distributive impacts, and equity; used the best reasonably obtainable information; identified performance objectives rather than behavior or manner of compliance; sought comments from, assessed effects on, and harmonized regulations with the functions of state, local, and tribal governments; avoided conflicts with or duplication of other existing regulations; tailored the regulatory action to impose the least burden on society; drafted the regulatory action to be simple and easy to understand; and  complied with requirements under executive orders, statutes, and applicable guidance.  OIRA must allow other agencies to review the draft regulatory action for at least 10 business days, solicit comments from other agencies, and facilitate conversations between agencies.  OIRA must provide an agency with the results of every standard, executive order, guidance document, and law reviewed.  As soon as practicable and before publication in the Federal Register of a significant regulatory action for which OIRA concluded review, the submitting agency shall make available to OIRA a redline of any changes the agency made to the regulatory action during the review period. The agency shall identify any change made at the suggestion or recommendation of any other agency, member of the public, or other source.  OIRA must make the redline available to the public online along with the information submitted by the agency for review, the results of OIRA's review, documents exchanged between OIRA senior officials and the agency during the review, and a list of each agency consultation with OIRA on the regulatory action. Agencies must publish on their websites: (1) a list of each active regulatory action, including an indication of the status or a link to its entry on the unified agenda; (2) their most recent regulatory plan; and (3) a link to each record disclosed by OIRA about the regulatory review. OIRA must ensure that records associated with each significant regulatory action: (1) are easily accessible for a period of time consistent with approved agency records disposition schedules, and (2) can be promptly submitted to Congress upon request.  This bill does not apply to agency statements: (1) issued in accordance with formal rulemaking provisions under the Administrative Procedure Act when rules are required by statute to be made on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing; (2) pertaining to certain military or foreign affairs functions; (3) limited to organization, management, or personnel matters; or (4) exempted by OIRA with a published explanation online that includes the date of the decision and the reasons for exemption. (Sec. 3) No additional funds are authorized to carry out this bill.","OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability Act  (Sec. 2) This bill codifies and revises the centralized regulatory review process, currently required under executive order, to require the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within the Office of Management and Budget to: (1) chair the Regulatory Working Group that assists agencies with regulatory issues, (2) publish a unified agenda of each agency's regulations that are under development or review, and (3) review each agency's si..."

The bill also eliminates, beginning in 2018, the state option to extend Medicaid coverage to non-elderly adults with incomes above 133% of the official poverty line. With respect to states that expanded Medicaid under PPACA, current law provides for transitional FMAP increases through 2019. The bill eliminates these increases after 2017, capping the FMAP at the 2017 level.  Under current law, any alternative benefit plan offered by a state Medicaid program is required to provide specified essential health benefits. The bill eliminates this requirement beginning in 2020. (""Essential health benefits"" include ambulatory patient services, emergency services, hospitalization, maternity and newborn care, mental health and substance use disorder services, prescription drugs, rehabilitative services, laboratory services, preventative and wellness services, and pediatric services.)  (Sec. 113) The bill: (1) exempts from Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payment reductions, states that did not implement Medicaid expansion under PPACA; and (2) eliminates DSH reductions after FY2019. (DSH hospitals receive additional payment under Medicaid for treating a large share of low-income patients.)  (Sec. 114) The bill specifies how a state must treat qualified lottery winnings and lump sum income, beginning in 2020, for purposes of determining an individual's income-based eligibility for a state Medicaid program. Specifically, a state shall include such winnings or income as income received: (1) in the month in which it was received, if the amount is less than $80,000; (2) over a period of two months, if the amount is at least $80,000 but less than $90,000; (3) over a period of three months, if the amount is at least $90,000 but less than $100,000; and (4) over an additional one-month period for each increment of $10,000 received, not to exceed 120 months. An individual whose income exceeds the applicable eligibility threshold due to qualified lump sum income may continue to be eligible for medical assistance to the extent that the state determines that denial of eligibility would cause undue medical or financial hardship.  Qualified lump sum income includes: (1) monetary winnings from gambling, and (2) income received as liquid assets from the estate of a deceased individual.  In addition, the bill eliminates the requirement for up to three months of retroactive coverage under Medicaid. Under current law, a state Medicaid program must provide coverage for up to three months prior to an individual's application for benefits if the individual would have been eligible for benefits during that period.  In addition, the bill disallows a state from using, for purposes of determining Medicaid eligibility for long-term care assistance, a home equity limit that exceeds the statutory minimum.  (Sec. 115) With respect to states that did not expand Medicaid coverage under PPACA, the bill: (1) with specified limitations, provides for additional federal funding for certain health care services; and (2) through FY2022, increases the applicable FMAP. A non-expansion state that subsequently expands Medicaid coverage under PPACA shall become ineligible for this funding.  (Sec. 116) No less frequently than every six months, states must redetermine the eligibility of adult enrollees made newly eligible for Medicaid by PPACA. The bill temporarily increases by 5% the FMAP for expenditures that are attributable to meeting this requirement.  (Sec. 117) The bill allows a state Medicaid program to impose a work requirement as a condition of eligibility. However, a program may not apply such a requirement to: (1) a pregnant woman, (2) the sole parent or caretaker of either a child younger than age 6 or a child with disabilities, (3) an individual younger than age 19, or (4) an individual younger than age 20 who is married or head of a household and either attends secondary school or participates in employment-related education. The bill increases by 5% the FMAP for certain administrative expenditures that are attributable to implementing a work requirement.  Subtitle C--Per Capita Allotment for Medical Assistance (Sec. 121) Under current law, state Medicaid programs are guaranteed federal matching funds for qualifying expenditures. The bill establishes limits on federal funding for state Medicaid programs beginning in FY2020. Specifically, the bill establishes targeted spending caps for each state, using a formula based on the state's FY2016 medical assistance expenditures in each enrollee category: (1) the elderly, (2) the blind and disabled, (3) children, (4) adults made newly eligible for Medicaid by PPACA, and (5) all other enrollees. With respect to a state that exceeds its targeted spending cap in a given fiscal year, the bill provides for reduced federal funding in the following fiscal year. In addition, the bill: (1) requires additional reporting and auditing of state data on medical assistance expenditures, and (2) temporarily increases the FMAP with respect to certain data reporting expenditures. The bill reduces targeted spending for certain states that require political subdivisions to contribute funds towards medical assistance. Specifically, the bill applies to states that received, for FY2016, DSH allotments greater than six times the national average. Specified contributions are excepted. A state Medicaid program may elect to receive, for any 10-year period beginning no earlier than FY2020, federal funding in block grant form. The bill establishes a formula, using targeted spending caps, for determining the amount of block grant funds. A state plan for administering a block grant shall specify: (1) conditions of eligibility for receiving health care assistance under the block grant; (2) the types, amount, duration, and scope of services to be covered; and (3) methods of delivery and cost-sharing with respect to covered services. Such a plan must: (1) provide for eligibility of specified children and pregnant women; and (2) offer assistance for hospital care, surgical care, medical care, obstetrical and prenatal care, prescribed drugs and prosthetic devices, other medical supplies, and pediatric care. Subtitle D--Patient Relief and Health Insurance Market Stability  (Sec. 131) After 2019, the bill eliminates cost sharing reductions for low-income individuals with certain health insurance.  (Sec. 132) The bill amends the SSAct to establish and make appropriations for the Patient and State Stability Fund. The fund is administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and provides funding to states through 2026, including to: provide financial assistance to high-risk individuals so they may enroll in health insurance, enter into arrangements with entities to stabilize health insurance premiums in the individual market, promote participation and increase options in the health insurance market, pay providers for services, and provide financial assistance to enrollees to reduce out-of-pocket costs.  Funding is allocated to states based on each state's share of incurred claims and uninsured individuals below the poverty line. To receive funding after 2019, states must provide matching funds at a rate that varies from 7% to 50% based on the year and whether the state applied for funding.  The bill increases appropriations for 2020 by $15 billion for maternity coverage, newborn care, and services for individuals with mental health or substance use disorders.  The bill establishes the Federal Invisible Risk Sharing Program, administered by the CMS, to pay health insurers for certain individuals' claims in order to lower premiums in the individual market. The bill appropriates $15 billion for this fund for 2019-2026. (Sec. 133) Health insurers must increase premiums by 30% for one year for enrollees in the individual market who had a break in coverage of more than 62 days in the previous year. States with programs under this bill to provide financial assistance to high-risk individuals or stabilize health insurance premiums in the individual market and states participating in the Federal Invisible Risk Sharing Program may apply for a waiver to allow health insurers, for individuals with a break in coverage, to vary premiums based on an individual's health status instead of increasing premiums by 30%.  The bill appropriates $8 billion for the Patient and State Stability Fund to be allocated to states with a waiver to allow premiums to vary by health status in order to reduce costs for individuals whose premiums increased due to the waiver.  (Sec. 134) Beginning in 2020, health insurance benefits no longer must conform to actuarial tiers (e.g., silver level benefits).  (Sec. 135) The bill increases the ratio by which health insurance premiums may vary by age, from a three to one ratio to a five to one ratio. This ratio may be preempted by states.  (Sec. 136) States may apply to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for waivers to increase the ratio by which health insurance premiums may vary by age and to waive the requirement for insurance to cover the essential health benefits.  These waivers and the waiver to allow premiums to vary by health status do not apply to health plans offered through the CO-OP program, multi-state plans, plans the federal government makes available to members of Congress and their staff, or plans under PPACA provisions that allow state flexibility.  Subtitle E--Implementation Funding  (Sec. 141) The bill establishes and appropriates $1 billion for the American Health Care Implementation Fund to provide for the implementation of programs in this bill TITLE II--COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS  Subtitle A--Repeal and Replace of Health-Related Tax Policy  Sections 201-203 and 214 of the bill make several modifications to the premium assistance tax credit, which is currently provided to eligible individuals and families to subsidize the purchase of health insurance plans on an exchange.  (Sec. 201) This section makes taxpayers liable for the full amount of excess advance payments of the credit. (Under current law, liability for certain low-income households is limited to an applicable dollar amount.)  (Sec. 202) This section modifies the premium assistance tax credit to:   make the credit available for catastrophic qualified health plans and plans that are not offered through an exchange, but otherwise meet the requirements for qualified health plans;  prohibit the credit from being used for grandfathered or grandmothered health plans;  prohibit the credit from being used for health plans that cover abortions (other than abortions necessary to save the life of the mother or abortions with respect to a pregnancy that is the result of an act of rape or incest); and  revise the formula used to calculate the credit using a schedule that varies with household income and the age of individuals or family members.   Advance payments of the credit may not be made with respect to any health plan that is not enrolled in through an exchange.  (Sec. 203) This section modifies the small employer tax credit for employee health insurance expenses to: (1) prohibit the credit from being used for health plans that include coverage for abortions (other than any abortion necessary to save the life of the mother or any abortion with respect to a pregnancy that is the result of an act of rape or incest) for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017; and (2) repeal the credit for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2019.  (Sec. 204) This section repeals the penalties for individuals who are not covered by a health plan that provides at least minimum essential coverage (commonly referred to as the individual mandate). The repeal is effective for months beginning after December 31, 2015. (Sec. 205) This section repeals the penalties for certain large employers who do not offer full-time employees and their dependents minimum essential health coverage under an employer-sponsored health plan (commonly referred to as the employer mandate). The repeal is effective for months beginning after December 31, 2015.  (Sec. 206) This section delays the implementation of the excise tax on high cost employer-sponsored health coverage (commonly referred to as the Cadillac tax) until 2026. (Under current law, the tax goes into effect in 2020.)  (Sec. 207) This section permits tax-favored health savings accounts (HSAs), Archer Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs), health flexible spending arrangements (FSAs), and health reimbursement arrangements to be used to purchase over-the-counter medicine that is not prescribed by a physician.  (Sec. 208) This section repeals the increase in the tax on distributions from HSAs and Archer MSAs that are not used for qualified medical expenses. The bill reduces the tax on HSA distributions from 20% to 10% and reduces the tax for Archer MSA's from 20% to 15% to return the taxes to the levels that existed prior to the enactment of PPACA.  (Sec. 209) This section repeals the limitation on FSA salary reduction contributions.  (Sec. 210) This section repeals the medical device excise tax for sales after December 31, 2016.  (Sec. 211) This section permits employers who provide Medicare-eligible retirees with qualified prescription drug coverage and receive federal subsidies for prescription drug plans to claim a deduction for the expenses without reducing the deduction by the amount of the subsidy.  (Sec. 212) This section reduces the income threshold used to determine whether an individual may claim an itemized deduction for unreimbursed medical expenses. The bill allows all taxpayers to claim an itemized deduction for unreimbursed expenses medical expenses that exceed 5.8% (10% under current law) of adjusted gross income.  (Sec. 213) This section repeals the additional Medicare tax that is imposed on certain employees and self-employed individuals with wages or self-employment income above specified thresholds.  (Sec. 214) The section modifies the premium assistance tax credit to allow a refundable, advanceable tax credit beginning in 2020 for certain individuals who purchase health insurance and who are not eligible for other sources of coverage.  To be eligible for the credit, an individual:   must be covered by health insurance that is certified by the state in which the insurance is offered as meeting the requirement of this bill;  may not be eligible for other specified sources of coverage;  must be either a U.S. citizen or national or a qualified alien; and  may not be incarcerated, other than incarceration pending the disposition of charges.   The credit is allowed for health insurance coverage that:   is offered in the individual health insurance market within a state;  substantially all of which is not for excepted benefits providing only limited coverage, such as dental, vision, or long-term care;  does not consist of short-term limited duration insurance; is not a grandfathered or grandmothered plan; and does not include coverage for abortions (other than any abortion necessary to save the life of the mother or any abortion with respect to a pregnancy that is the result of an act of rape or incest).   The bill specifies credit amounts which are based on age and adjusted gross income. It also limits the annual credit amount to $14,000 per family.  The Department of the Treasury and HHS must prescribe regulations to establish and operate the advance payment program, with respect to the credit for individuals covered under qualified health plans (whether enrolled in through an exchange or otherwise), in such a manner that protects taxpayer information, provides robust verification of all information necessary to establish eligibility of taxpayer for advance payments, ensures proper and timely payments to appropriate health providers, and protects program integrity.  (Sec. 215) This section increases the limits on HSA contributions to match the sum of the annual deductible and out-of-pocket expenses permitted under a high deductible health plan.  (Sec. 216) This section permits both spouses of a married couple who are eligible for HSA catch-up contributions to make the contributions to the same HSA account.  (Sec. 217) This section permits an HSA to be used to pay certain medical expenses that were incurred before the HSA was established. If the HSA is established during the 60-day period beginning on the date that an individual's coverage under a high deductible health plan begins, the HSA is treated as having been established on the date coverage under the high deductible health plan begins to determine whether an amount paid is used for a qualified medical expense.  Subtitle B--Repeal of Certain Consumer Taxes (Sec. 221) This section repeals the annual fee on branded prescription pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers.  (Sec. 222) This section repeals the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share.  Subtitle C--Repeal of Tanning Tax  (Sec. 231) This section repeals the 10% excise tax on the price of indoor tanning services.  Subtitle D--Remuneration From Certain Insurers  (Sec. 241) The section repeals a provision that prohibits certain health insurance providers from deducting remuneration paid to an officer, director, or employee in excess of $500,000.  Subtitle E--Repeal of Net Investment Income Tax  (Sec. 251) This section repeals the 3.8% tax on the net investment income of individuals, estates, and trusts with incomes above specified amounts. ","American Health Care Act of 2017 TITLE I--ENERGY AND COMMERCE Subtitle A--Patient Access to Public Health Programs  (Sec. 101) This bill amends the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) to eliminate funding after FY2018 for the Prevention and Public Health Fund, which provides for investment in prevention and public health programs to improve health and restrain the rate of growth in health care costs. Funds that are unobligated at the end of FY2018 are rescinded.  (Sec. 102) The..."

The FDIC's orderly liquidation authority, as established under the Dodd-Frank Act, allows the FDIC to liquidate a failing financial institution if the institution's imminent failure threatens financial stability. Subtitle B--Financial Institution Bankruptcy (Sec. 121) Newly established provisions related to Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which generally involves the reorganization of a debtor's assets and debts, shall apply to covered financial corporations (certain large and complex financial institutions, as defined by the bill).  Under specified circumstances, a court may convert a covered financial corporation's Chapter 11 bankruptcy case into a case under Chapter 7 bankruptcy (also known as ""liquidation"" bankruptcy).

(Sec. 123) The Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court shall designate judges to hear Chapter 11 bankruptcy cases involving covered financial corporations. Subtitle C--Ending Government Guarantees (Sec. 131) The bill repeals the FDIC's authority, under the Dodd-Frank Act, to guarantee bank debt during times of severe economic distress. (Sec. 132) Current law generally requires the FDIC to utilize the least-costly method when using the Deposit Insurance Fund to resolve failing banks; however, in an exception to this requirement, the FDIC may take other action or provide assistance to avoid or mitigate serious adverse effects on economic conditions or financial stability. The bill repeals this exception. (Sec. 133) The Exchange Stabilization Fund may not be used for the establishment of a guaranty program for any nongovernmental entity. Subtitle D--Eliminating Financial Market Utility Designations (Sec. 141) The bill repeals the authority of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) to designate financial market utilities (i.e., payment, clearing, and settlement systems) as ""systemically important"" (also known as ""too big to fail"").  Under current law, entities so designated are subject to additional regulatory restrictions.

The bill repeals: (1) provisions related to the authority of the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) to supervise and take enforcement action against non-bank financial companies; (2) the prohibition against management interlocks in certain financial companies (i.e., the prohibition against a management official serving simultaneously in two unaffiliated organizations); and (3) specified early-remediation requirements applicable to non-bank financial companies in financial distress. With respect to FSOC, the bill modifies council membership, voting procedures, open meetings requirements, and duties. In addition, the bill subjects FSOC to the congressional appropriations process.

In addition, the bill modifies procedures for: (1) the submission and federal review of ""living wills"" (i.e., companies' plans for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of financial distress or failure); and (2) the stress testing of bank holding companies. The FRB may not, on an emergency basis, approve an application that would cause a company to become a bank holding company, unless the application involves the company's acquisition of a bank that is critically undercapitalized. Specified concentration limits applicable to large financial firms under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 shall apply only to banking organizations. (Sec. 152) A federal banking agency may not establish an operational-risk capital requirement for banking organizations unless the requirement: (1) is based on, and is appropriately sensitive to, current risks; (2) is determined under a forward-looking assessment of potential losses; and (3) allows certain adjustments. TITLE II--DEMANDING ACCOUNTABILITY FROM WALL STREET Subtitle A--SEC Penalties Modernization (Sec. 211) The bill amends the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to increase civil monetary penalties that may be imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for various securities laws violations. With respect to a failure to comply with an injunction or order relating to a violation of one of these laws, each day shall be deemed a separate offense.

Subtitle B--Congressional Review of Federal Financial Agency Rulemaking (Sec. 331) Before a rule may take effect, the promulgating federal financial regulatory agency must report to Congress and the GAO on any cost-benefit analysis of the rule and other specified information.

(Sec. 338) This subtitle of the bill shall not apply to rules concerning monetary policy. Subtitle C--Judicial Review of Agency Actions (Sec. 341) In general, the standard for judicial review of an action by a federal financial agency shall be de novo (i.e., without deference to the agency).

In implementing the safe harbor, the SEC must prohibit a self-regulatory organization (SRO) from maintaining or enforcing a rule that would prevent a member from: (1) publishing or distributing a covered investment fund research report solely because the member is also participating in a registered offering of the fund, or (2) participating in a registered offering of a covered investment fund solely because the member has published a research report about the fund.

Subtitle F--Accelerating Access to Capital (Sec. 426) The SEC must allow certain smaller companies to use a simplified registration form. Subtitle G--Enhancing the RAISE Act (Sec. 431) The bill modifies the requirements that must be met in order for certain accredited-investor transactions to be exempt from prohibitions against interstate solicitation.

(Sec. 715) Under current law, a person may file a petition with the CFPB, subject to judicial review, for an order to modify or set aside a civil investigative demand made by the CFPB.

(Sec. 817) The SEC must establish a process for closing investigations, as specified by the bill. (Sec. 818) The bill establishes an Enforcement Ombudsman to act as a liaison between the SEC and any person who is the subject of an SEC investigation or enforcement action.

(Sec. 820) The SEC must establish an advisory committee on the SEC's enforcement policies and practices. (Sec. 821) The SEC must establish a process to allow a recipient of a Wells notification (i.e., a written notice that the SEC is planning to bring an enforcement action against the recipient) to make an in-person presentation before the SEC. A written report of any such presentation must be produced by SEC staff.

(Sec. 842) The bill exempts asset-backed securities that are comprised wholly of nonresidential mortgages from certain risk-retention requirements. (Sec. 843) Current law requires shareholder approval with respect to an issuer's compensation of executives no less frequently than once every three years. The bill instead requires such approval only when there has been a material change to executive compensation from the previous year. (Sec. 844) Current regulations allow the resubmission of a shareholder proposal that has been previously included in the issuer's proxy materials if, when the proposal was last included, it received less than a specified percentage of the vote; this percentage, which varies depending upon the number of times a proposal has been previously submitted, represents the minimum threshold at which resubmission is permissible. The bill directs the SEC to increase this threshold. In addition, the SEC must revise its regulations with respect to the holding requirement for a shareholder to be eligible to submit a shareholder proposal to an issuer for inclusion in the issuer's proxy statement.  Specifically, the SEC must eliminate the option for a shareholder to satisfy the holding requirement by holding a certain dollar amount (under current regulations, $2,000). The SEC must also extend the requisite holding period from one year to three years.

(Sec. 846) An issuer of municipal securities shall not be required to retain a municipal advisor prior to issuing such securities.

(Sec. 848) The SEC must adhere to specified timeframes with respect to granting or rejecting an application for an exemption from requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940. If the SEC denies such an application, it must provide the applicant with a written explanation and an opportunity for a hearing. (Sec. 849) Current law requires an issuer to establish a policy for the recovery of certain erroneously awarded executive compensation. The bill specifies that this requirement applies only with respect to recovery from an executive officer who had control or authority over the financial reporting that resulted in the error. (Sec. 850) The SEC may exempt a person from registration requirements applicable to a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSO) if: (1) such requirements create a barrier to entry into the market for, or impede competition among, NRSOs; or (2) such an exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and is consistent with the protection of investors. (Sec. 851) Under current law, the SEC's Office of Credit Ratings is required to conduct annual examinations of each NRSO. The bill specifies that such examinations shall be risk-based and removes the requirement that they be conducted at least annually. (Sec. 852) Current law requires each NRSO to disclose to the SEC certain information related to the NRSO's credit rating procedures and methodologies. The bill prohibits the SEC from: (1) mandating the specific organization of such disclosures, or (2) requiring that such disclosures include references to statutory or regulatory requirements. (Sec. 853) The bill repeals the requirement for each NRSO to include, with any credit rating it issues, an attestation affirming that: (1) no part of the rating was influenced by other business activities, (2) the rating was based solely on the merits of the instruments being rated, and (3) the rating was an independent evaluation of the instrument's risks and merits. The bill also repeals the requirement for each NRSO to include in its annual internal-controls report an attestation of its chief executive officer. (Sec. 854) The bill limits the applicability of certain look-back review requirements for NRSOs. (Sec. 856) A person who sells or markets the products or services of an NRSO may provide certain material information relating to credit ratings to a person who determines or monitors credit ratings, so long as the information is not intended to influence credit-rating determinations. (Sec. 857) The bill repeals provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that:  authorize the SEC to engage in investor testing;  authorize the SEC to restrict the use of mandatory pre-dispute arbitration;  provide for equal treatment of SRO rules;  with respect to short sales, establish specified public-disclosure and investor-notification requirements;  prohibit manipulative short sales of securities;  lessen requirements with respect to pleading state of mind in a private action against an NRSO;  apply the fair disclosure rule (which requires publicly traded companies to disclose material information to all investors at the same time) to NRSOs;  subject credit rating agencies to expert liability;  require an issuer to make specified disclosures;  prohibit covered financial institutions with assets in excess of $1 billion from using certain incentive-based payment arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks;  require the SEC's Division of Trading and Markets to employ a staff of compliance examiners;  allow the SEC to issue specified rules regarding proxy access;  allow the SEC to require a registered national securities association to establish a fee to fund the Governmental Accounting Standards Board;  direct the SEC to issue rules to increase the transparency of securities-lending information available to brokers, dealers, and investors; and  establish a grant program to support state efforts to protect seniors from fraudulent marketing. (Sec. 858) In general, an investment adviser shall not be subject to registration and reporting requirements under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 with respect to the provision of investment advice relating to a private equity fund. (Sec. 860) The bill expands the category of investors that may be considered ""accredited investors"" for purposes of participating in private offerings.

Subtitle C--Harmonization of Derivatives Rules (Sec. 871) The SEC and the CFTC must review specified rules relating to swap markets. (Sec. 872) The bill exempts swap transactions between affiliates from swap rules issued by the SEC or the CFTC. TITLE IX--REPEAL OF THE VOLCKER RULE AND OTHER PROVISIONS (Sec. 901) The bill lifts the moratorium on the FDIC's provision of deposit insurance to industrial banks, credit-card banks, and certain trust banks. The bill eliminates the FRB's supervisory authority over securities holding companies. The bill repeals the ""Volcker Rule,"" which prohibits banking agencies from engaging in proprietary trading or entering into certain relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds. Current law prohibits an underwriter, placement agent, initial purchaser, or sponsor of an asset-backed security from engaging, within one year after the first closing of the sale of the asset-backed security, in a transaction that would involve a material conflict of interest. The bill repeals this prohibition. TITLE X--FED OVERSIGHT REFORM AND MODERNIZATION (Sec. 1001) The bill amends the Federal Reserve Act to require the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to, after each meeting, submit to Congress a Directive Policy Rule for open market operations that includes specified information and meets certain other requirements. (Sec. 1002) The bill restricts the type of public communications that FOMC members and staff may make regarding financial developments or monetary policy during a ""blackout period"" (i.e., a period extending from approximately one week before an FOMC meeting to approximately one day afterwards). (Sec. 1003) The FOMC must make full transcripts of its meetings available to the public. (Sec. 1004) The bill alters the membership of the FOMC. (Sec. 1005) The Chairman of the FRB must testify to Congress quarterly, rather than semiannually.

(Sec. 1008) The bill limits the FRB's emergency-lending authority to cases in which the financial stability of the United States is threatened. Moreover, the FRB may not exercise its emergency-lending authority without the affirmative votes of at least nine Federal Reserve bank presidents.  The FRB must issue specified rules regarding: (1) the collateral required to secure loans made under its emergency-lending authority, and (2) the minimum interest rate on loans made under its emergency-lending authority. A borrower shall be ineligible to borrow from an emergency-lending program unless the borrower is certified by the FRB and federal banking regulators as solvent. (Sec. 1010) The bill removes specified limitations on GAO audits of the FRB and Federal Reserve banks. (Sec. 1011) The bill establishes the Centennial Monetary Commission and tasks the commission with studying specified issues related to monetary policy. TITLE XI--IMPROVING INSURANCE COORDINATION THROUGH AN INDEPENDENT ADVOCATE (Sec. 1101) The bill: (1) eliminates the Federal Insurance Office, which is tasked under the Dodd-Frank Act to monitor the insurance sector; and (2) establishes the Office of the Independent Insurance Advocate, which is authorized under the bill to provide coordination and consultation with respect to insurance matters.

(Sec. 2) In general, the statute of limitations is three years after the occurrence of the breach or tort, three years after medical or health-care treatment for the injury is completed, or one year after the claimant discovers the injury, whichever occurs first. For a minor, the statute of limitations is three years after the occurrence of the breach or tort or three years after medical or health-care treatment for the injury is completed, whichever occurs first, except for a minor under six years old, for whom it is the later of three years after the occurrence of the breach or tort, three years after medical or health-care treatment for the injury is completed, one year after discovery of the injury, or the minor's eighth birthday. These limitations are tolled under certain circumstances. These provisions do not preempt certain state laws. (Sec. 3) Noneconomic damages are limited to $250,000, before accounting for reductions in damages required by law. Juries may not be informed of this limitation. Parties are liable for the amount of damages directly proportional to their responsibility. These provisions do not preempt state laws that specify a particular monetary amount of damages. (Sec. 4) Courts must supervise the payment of damages and may restrict attorney contingent fees. The bill sets limits on contingent fees. The bill does not preempt state laws that specify a lesser percentage or value of damages that may be claimed by an attorney representing a claimant.

37,hr3003,"To amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to modify provisions relating to assistance by States, and political subdivision of States, in the enforcement of Federal immigration laws, and for other purposes.","(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.) No Sanctuary for Criminals Act  (Sec. 2) This bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to prohibit any federal, state, or local government or any individual from prohibiting any government entity, official, or employee from complying with the immigration laws or cooperating with federal law enforcement of such laws. The bill expands the scope of law enforcement activities relating to immigration-related information that a federal, state, or local government may not restrict or prohibit to include: (1) making inquiries to an individual in order to obtain immigration-related information regarding any individual, (2) notifying the federal government regarding the presence of individuals who are encountered by law enforcement officials or other state or local personnel, or (3) complying with federal law enforcement requests for such information.   A state or political subdivision not in compliance with such immigration enforcement provisions shall be ineligible to receive grants or assistance for: (1) incarceration of undocumented aliens; (2) the Cops on the Beat program; (3) the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice program; or (4) any Department of Justice (DOJ) or Department of Homeland Security (DHS) grant substantially related to law enforcement, terrorism, national security, immigration, or naturalization.  DHS: (1) may decline to transfer an alien in its custody to a non-complying state or political subdivision regardless of whether the state or political subdivision has issued a writ or warrant, (2) shall not transfer an alien with a final order of removal to a non-complying state or political subdivision, and (3) shall determine and report annually regarding non-complying states or political subdivisions.  At the request of the House or Senate Judiciary Committee, DHS shall issue a compliance report about any state or political subdivision. A non-complying jurisdiction shall be ineligible for federal financial assistance for at least one year and shall become eligible only after DHS certifies that it is in compliance.   Funds that are not allocated to a noncomplying state or political subdivision shall be reallocated to a complying state or political subdivision. (Sec. 3) In the case of an individual who is arrested by any federal, state, or local law enforcement official or other personnel for the alleged violation of a criminal or motor vehicle law, DHS may issue a detainer to any federal, state, or local law enforcement entity, official, or other personnel if DHS has probable cause to believe that such individual is an inadmissible or deportable alien. (Current law applies only to an individual arrested for a controlled substance violation and requires an enforcement officer to have reason to believe that such individual is unlawfully present in the United States.) The bill prescribes probable cause criteria.   DHS may take custody of a properly detained individual within 48-96 hours after the date that the individual is otherwise to be released from federal, state, or local custody.  The bill provides states, political subdivisions, official personnel, and contractor entities and personnel with immunity from liability for temporarily detaining, within the scope of their duties, an alien for DHS transfer to the same extent provided for corresponding federal immunity. The United States shall be the proper defendant in any civil action arising from such detainer.  Immunity shall not apply in instances of mistreatment.  A victim (or family member of a deceased victim) of murder, rape, or certain felonies committed by an alien who has been convicted and sentenced to at least one year in prison may bring an action against a state or political subdivision that released such alien prior to the crime's commission as a consequence of the state or political subdivision's declining to honor a detainer.   Such an action may not be brought later than 10 years after the crime or the person's death because of such crime, whichever occurs later. A court shall allow a prevailing plaintiff attorney's fees and certain other costs. (Sec. 4) DHS may detain an alien without time limitation during the pendency of removal proceedings. Bond is permitted only for an individual who is not a flight risk or a danger to another person or the community.   The bill expands the categories of offenses requiring mandatory detention during the pendency of removal proceedings to include an alien who: (1) is unlawfully present in the United States and has been convicted for driving while intoxicated, under the influence, or impaired by alcohol or drugs, without regard to whether the conviction is classified as a misdemeanor or felony under state law; and (2) is inadmissible for illegal entry or deportable by reason of visa revocation or violation of nonimmigrant status and who has been arrested or charged with a particularly serious crime or a crime resulting in the death or serious bodily injury of another person.   An alien subject to mandatory detention may not be released on bond.  The bill limits DOJ's review of DHS custody determinations for aliens who are in exclusion hearings, or who are excludable or deportable on security grounds or other specified grounds, to issues of whether such aliens may be detained or released with or without bond.","(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced.

The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)

The bill provides that an alien who has been excluded, deported, removed, or denied admission, or who has departed the United States while under an outstanding order of exclusion, deportation, or removal, and who subsequently crosses or attempts to cross the border into the United States, shall be fined, imprisoned not more than two years, or both. (""Crosses the border"" refers to the physical act of crossing the border, regardless of whether the alien is free from official restraint.)  The bill revises reentry of criminal offender provisions to provide that an alien who was convicted before such removal or departure of:    three or more misdemeanors or for a felony shall be fined, imprisoned up to 10 years, or both;  a felony for which the alien was sentenced to not less than 30 months in prison shall be fined, imprisoned up to 15 years, or both;  a felony for which the alien was sentenced to not less than 60 months shall be fined, imprisoned up to 20 years, or both; or  murder, rape, kidnapping, or a felony offense relating to peonage and slavery or terrorism, or of three or more felonies of any kind, shall be fined, imprisoned up to 25 years, or both.  An alien who has been excluded, deported, removed, or denied admission three or more times and thereafter enters, attempts to enter, or crosses or attempts to cross the border to, or is at any time found in, the United States shall be fined, imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both. The bill states that it shall be an affirmative defense to a reentry violation (thus placing the burden of proof on the defendant) that: (1) prior to the alleged violation, the alien had received Department of Homeland Security (DHS) consent to reapply for U.S. admission; or (2) with respect to an alien previously denied admission and removed, the alien was not required to obtain such advance consent and had complied with all other applicable admissions laws and regulations.  In a criminal proceeding under this section, an alien may not challenge the validity of any prior removal order. (Currently, the validity of a prior deportation order may be challenged under certain grounds.) A removed alien who enters, attempts to enter, or crosses or attempts to cross the border to, or is at any time found in, the United States shall be incarcerated for the remainder of the sentence that was pending at the time of deportation without any reduction for parole or supervised release unless the alien affirmatively demonstrates that DHS has consented to the alien's reentry.

(Sec. 2) The bill delays the implementation of the ozone NAAQS that were published in 2015. The bill extends until: (1) October 26, 2024, the deadline for states to submit designations to implement the 2015 ozone NAAQS; and (2) October 26, 2025, the deadline for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to designate state areas as attainment, nonattainment, or unclassifiable areas with respect to the 2015 ozone NAAQS. States must submit a state implementation plan (SIP) by October 26, 2026, to implement, maintain, and enforce the 2015 ozone NAAQS. The bill exempts from the 2015 ozone standards certain preconstruction permit applications that were completed or submitted before a final designation was made. (Sec. 3) The bill also changes the review cycle for criteria pollutant NAAQS from a 5-year review cycle to a 10-year review cycle. The EPA may not complete its next review of ozone NAAQS before October 26, 2025.  The EPA may consider, as a secondary consideration, likely technological feasibility in establishing and revising NAAQS for a pollutant if a range of air quality levels for such pollutant are requisite to protect public health with an adequate margin of safety. Prior to establishing or revising NAAQS, the EPA must obtain advice from its scientific advisory committee regarding potential adverse public health, welfare, social, economic, or energy effects which may result from attaining and maintaining NAAQS. The EPA must publish regulations and guidance for implementing NAAQS concurrently with the issuance of a new or revised standard. New or revised NAAQS shall not apply to preconstruction permits for constructing or modifying a stationary source of air pollutants until those regulations and guidance have been published. The bill provides that in Extreme Ozone Nonattainment Areas, contingency measures are not required to be included in nonattainment plans. Technological achievability and economic feasibility must be taken into consideration in plan revisions for milestones for particulate matter nonattainment areas.  The bill redefines ""exceptional events,"" by including stagnation of air masses that are not ordinarily occurring. The EPA must: (1) report on foreign emissions and their impact on compliance with the NAAQS program in the United States, (2) study and report on the atmospheric formation of ozone and effective control strategies, and (3) incorporate the results of the study into rules and guidance implementing the 2015 ozone standards. (Sec. 4) The bill exempts states from sanctions or fees for nonattainment or deficiency relating to certain ozone and particulate matter if the state can demonstrate specified circumstances preventing attainment. This exemption shall not affect any obligation of states or localities under the Clean Air Act to attain a NAAQS for ozone or particulate matter.

TITLE IV--BUDGET PROCESS  Subtitle A--Budget Enforcement  (Sec. 4101) Updates the existing point of order against advanced appropriations to conform to the new budget window. (Under this section, an advanced appropriation is any new budget authority provided in appropriations legislation for FY2018 that first becomes available after FY2018, or any new budget authority provided in appropriations legislation for FY2019 that first becomes available after FY2019. The point of order limits advanced appropriations to specified accounts and prohibits total advanced appropriations from exceeding $28.852 billion in new budget authority in each year).  (Sec. 4102) Extends the point of order restricting the inclusion of certain changes in mandatory programs (CHIMPS) to appropriations legislation for FY2018-FY2020. Limits CHIMPS that reduce budget authority in the budget year but do not decrease outlays over the period of the total of the current year, budget year, and all fiscal years covered under the most recently adopted budget resolution.

(Sec. 4106) Repeals the existing Senate Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) point of order that prohibits the consideration of legislation that would cause or increase an on-budget deficit over specified six- and eleven-year time periods.  Replaces the point of order with a new PAYGO point of order that continues the six-year and eleven-year time periods and adds two additional time periods during which the legislation may not cause or increase an on-budget deficit: (1) the current year, and (2) the budget year.  (Sec. 4107) Directs the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Joint Committee on Taxation to provide estimates of the macroeconomic effects of major legislation. (These estimates are frequently referred to as dynamic scoring and include estimates of the budgetary effects from changes in economic output, employment, capital stock, interest rates, and other macroeconomic variables resulting from the legislation.) Requires the estimates, to the extent practicable, to include the distributional effects across income categories resulting from major legislation.

(Sec. 4113) Permits the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to file in the Congressional Record committee allocations enforcing this resolution if the resolution passes both the House and Senate in identical form, a conference committee is not convened, and a joint explanatory statement is not produced.  Subtitle B--Other Provisions  (Sec. 4201) Directs Senate committees to review programs and tax expenditures within their jurisdiction to identify waste, fraud, abuse, or duplication and increase the use of performance data to inform committee work.  (Sec. 4202) Requires the joint explanatory statement accompanying the conference report on the budget resolution to include amounts for the discretionary administrative expenses of the Social Security Administration and the U.S. Postal Service in the allocations to the appropriations committees. Specifies that, in the Senate, the amounts must be included in estimates of the total new budget authority and total outlays provided by a measure that are used to enforce committee allocations.  (Sec. 4203) Sets forth procedures for adjustments of the allocations and aggregates included in the budget resolution.  (Sec. 4204) Permits the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to adjust levels and allocations in this budget resolution to reflect changes in concepts and definitions.

(Sec. 4206) Declares that the provisions in this title are promulgated under the Senate's rulemaking power and will be considered part of the rules of the Senate.  TITLE V--BUDGET PROCESS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Subtitle A--Budget Enforcement (Sec. 5101) Requires the CBO to estimate whether legislation (other than appropriations measures) would cause a net increase in direct spending in excess of $2.5 billion over any of the 4 consecutive 10-year periods beginning in FY2027. Establishes a point of order against legislation (other than appropriations measures) with a net effect of increasing direct spending by more than $2.5 billion in any of the 4 consecutive 10-year periods. Specifies that this provision has no force or effect after September 30, 2018. (Sec. 5102) Provides the House Appropriations Committee with a separate allocation for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism and specifies procedures for enforcing and adjusting the allocation. (Sec. 5103) Establishes a point of order restricting the inclusion of certain changes in mandatory programs (CHIMPS) in appropriations legislation for FY2018-FY2020. Limits CHIMPS that reduce budget authority in the budget year but do not decrease outlays over the period of the total of the current year, budget year, and all fiscal years covered under the most recently agreed to budget resolution. Limit the CHIMPS to: $19.1 billion for FY2018, $17 billion for FY2019, and $15 billion for FY2020. (Sec. 5104) Prohibits advance appropriations unless: (1) the appropriation is provided for an account listed as an exception in the report accompanying this resolution, and (2) total advance appropriations do not exceed specified limits. (Under this section, an advance appropriation is any new discretionary budget authority provided in appropriations legislation for the fiscal year following FY2018.) (Sec. 5105) Permits the chair of the House Budget Committee to direct the CBO to include changes in debt service costs in estimates of legislation except for authorizations of discretionary programs or appropriation measures.  Specifies that: (1) this section applies to changes in the authorization level of appropriated entitlements, and (2) the estimates are advisory and may not be used for budget enforcement. (Sec. 5106) Requires the CBO, upon request of the chairman of the House Budget Committee, to include supplemental fair-value estimates in estimates for legislation establishing or modifying a loan or loan guarantee program.  Requires the CBO to provide a supplemental fair-value estimate for legislation establishing or modifying a loan or loan guarantee program for student financial assistance or housing (including residential mortgage).  Requires the CBO to include estimates, on a fair-value and credit reform basis, of loan and loan guarantee programs for student financial assistance, housing (including residential mortgage), and other major loan and loan guarantee programs in its ""Budget and Economic Outlook: 2018 to 2027.""  Permits the chairman of the House Budget Committee to use the fair-value estimates provided pursuant to this section for budget enforcement purposes.  (A fair-value estimate is an alternative to federal credit program estimates required by the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 [FCRA]. Under FCRA, cash flows are discounted using Treasury interest rates for estimating subsidy costs. The fair-value method incorporates market risk by using market rates.) (Sec. 5107) Requires the CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation to incorporate macroeconomic effects in estimates of specified legislation (commonly referred to as dynamic scoring). (Sec. 5108) Authorizes the chairman of the House Budget Committee to adjust committee allocations and levels in this resolution if legislation decreases direct spending in any fiscal year and authorizes appropriations for the same purpose.

Specifies that the contracts are to be scored as direct spending and that savings resulting from the contracts may be not be used as an offset for budget enforcement purposes.  (Under an energy savings performance contract, a private party agrees to fund energy-efficient upgrades for a federal facility, and the federal agency agrees to pay the private party from reductions in the agency's energy costs. Under a utility energy service contract, the services and equipment are provided by a utility.) (Sec. 5110) Requires transfers of funds from the general fund of the Treasury to the Highway Trust Fund to be counted as new budget authority and outlays in the year the transfer occurs. (Sec. 5111) Prohibits transfers of surpluses of the Federal Reserve System from being counted as offsets for budget enforcement purposes. (This section prevents the transfers from being used to offset provisions that increase the deficit in determining whether a budget point of order applies to legislation.) (Sec. 5112) Prohibits increases in Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) guarantee fees from being used for budget enforcement purposes. (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchase mortgages and charge the fees to guarantee the payment of principal and interest. This section prevents the fee increases from being used to offset provisions that increase the deficit in determining whether a budget point of order applies to legislation.) (Sec. 5113) Modifies the reconciliation instructions included in this resolution for House committees to: (1) specify that section 2002 of this resolution shall have no force and effect, and (2) direct the House Ways and Means Committee to report to the House of Representatives by November 13, 2017, changes in laws within its jurisdiction that increase the deficit by no more than $1.5 trillion over FY2018-FY2027.  Subtitle B--Other Provisions  (Sec. 5201) Specifies that the administrative expenses of the Social Security Administration and the U.S. Postal Service are reflected in the allocation to the House Appropriations Committee to ensure that the committee retains control over the expenses through the annual appropriations process. Specifies that, in the House, the amounts must be included in estimates of the total new budget authority and total outlays provided by a measure that are used to enforce committee allocations.

Permits the chairman of the House Budget Committee to adjust other appropriate levels in this concurrent resolution depending on congressional action on pending reconciliation legislation.

(Sec. 5204) Authorizes the chair of the House Budget Committee to adjust the aggregates, allocations, reconciliation targets, and other levels in this resolution for any changes that the CBO makes to its baseline for FY2018-FY2027. (Sec. 5205) Waives the point of order that would otherwise apply to appropriations legislation that exceeds the statutory limits on discretionary spending if the legislation would not cause this resolution's 302(a) allocation for the appropriations committee to be exceeded. (Sec. 5206) Permits the allocations and lists included in this resolution to be enforced in the House if this resolution is adopted in the House without the appointment of a conference committee.  Requires the chairman of the House Budget Committee to submit for a publication in the Congressional Record a statement specifying: (1) committee allocations; and (2) programs, projects, and activities identified as advance appropriations for the purpose of enforcing section 5104 of this resolution. (Sec. 5207) Affirms that the adoption of this title and section 2002 of this budget resolution is an exercise of the House's rulemaking power and that the House has the constitutional right to change these rules. Subtitle C--Adjustment Authority (Sec. 5301) Permits the chairman of the House Budget Committee to adjust the committee allocations, aggregates, allocations, levels, and limits contained this resolution if, during the 115th Congress, a measure becomes law that amends the discretionary spending limits established under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 to increase the limit for the revised security category for FY2018 to $640 billion.

(Sec. 107) FEMA must clearly communicate to policyholders their property's full flood risk, the history of flood claims on their property, and the effect of filing further claims. (Sec. 108) FEMA must make data on historical claims, required coverage, and previous damage available to the current owner of the property within 30 days of a request.  (Sec. 109) State or local governments must require a seller or lessor to disclose to a purchaser or lessee any previous flood damage or flood insurance claims, and any obligation to purchase flood insurance. This requirement, whether by statute or regulation, must be adopted for the area to qualify for participation in NFIP.  (Sec. 110) FEMA may create a community-wide flood insurance pilot program that covers all residential and non-residential properties and satisfies the mandatory purchase requirement. (Federal agencies that oversee mortgage lending must mandate the purchase of flood insurance for properties located in special flood hazard areas.)  (Sec. 111) FEMA must incorporate the replacement cost value of a structure insured under NFIP in its consideration of chargeable premium rates.  FEMA must conduct a study regarding risk rating redesign utilizing replacement cost and report the findings to Congress.  (Sec. 112) The flood insurance premium for a residential property having four or fewer residences is limited to no more than $10,000 a year, subject to adjustments for future inflation.  (Sec. 113) In determining premium rates, FEMA shall offer a rate reduction if policyholders implement specified flood damage mitigation methods. Mitigation techniques that qualify for a rate reduction include methods that can be utilized on a block or neighborhood scale, and the elevation of mechanical systems.  (Sec. 114) FEMA shall conduct a study of the feasibility of providing coverage for individual units in cooperative housing projects.  (Sec. 115) FEMA is directed to establish a pilot program for ""Write Your Own"" companies (companies that write and service federal standard flood insurance policies in their own name) to investigate preexisting structural conditions in properties that may result in a denial of a claim in the event of a flood loss under NFIP.  (Sec. 116) The bill establishes a Federal Flood Insurance Advisory Committee.  (Sec. 117) The bill directs federal lending regulation entities and FEMA to update interagency guidance regarding flood insurance.  (Sec. 118) The bill directs the GAO to report on claims adjustment practices under NFIP.  (Sec. 119) The bill directs the GAO to report on NFIP coverage of earth movement and subsidence caused by flooding. TITLE II--INCREASING CONSUMER CHOICE THROUGH PRIVATE MARKET DEVELOPMENT (Sec. 201) The bill revises the financial requirements that apply to flood insurance for home loans or loan guarantees by the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac). Private flood insurance must meet any financial strength requirements set forth by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Private flood insurance may include policies issued by nonadmitted insurers (including surplus lines insurance) as long as the insurer is eligible to provide insurance in the home state of the insured and complies with the laws and regulations of that state. (Currently, private flood insurance must provide coverage at least as broad as coverage provided by NFIP.) FEMA must consider any period during which a property was continuously covered by private flood insurance to be a period of continuous insurance coverage, including for the purposes of NFIP subsidies. Mutual aid societies may sell private flood insurance, subject to state law. The bill defines a mutual aid society as an organization of members who share a common set of ethical or religious beliefs. This coverage satisfies the mandatory purchase requirement. (Sec. 202) The required purchase of flood insurance is limited to residential properties (currently, the requirement applies to all types of property). (Sec. 203) FEMA must allow a Write Your Own company to sell private flood insurance.  (Sec. 204) FEMA must provide data related to NFIP risks and premiums, including community-level data, through a publicly available data system.  (Sec. 205) If an NFIP policyholder switches to private flood insurance during the NFIP coverage period, FEMA must refund any unused NFIP premium. Properties that have received a claim payment for that period or Increased Cost of Compliance mitigation assistance are not eligible for a refund.  (Sec. 206) The GAO must report on the feasibility of reducing flood insurance premiums and eliminating the need for flood insurance coverage by authorizing flood damage savings accounts.  (Sec. 207) If determined feasible by the GAO, FEMA must establish a demonstration program for flood damage savings accounts.  TITLE III--MAPPING FAIRNESS (Sec. 301) In establishing premium rates, FEMA must use, in part, applicable flood insurance rate maps and other appropriate risk assessment models, data, and tools.  (Sec. 302) FEMA denials of requests for updates to flood maps may be appealed. If an appeal is successful, FEMA must refund premiums and the policyholder may be permitted to cancel the policy.  (Sec. 303) The bill revises the appeal period for FEMA flood elevation determinations and, if no appeals are filed, makes a determination final.  (Sec. 304) This bill amends the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 to revise the time period FEMA provides to communities for consultation regarding mapping changes.  (Sec. 305) FEMA must consult with the Department of Defense, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to obtain information relevant to flood insurance mapping.  (Sec. 306) The bill revises the duties of the Technical Mapping Advisory Council and FEMA to provide for the development of alternative flood insurance rate maps by states and communities for use in NFIP.  TITLE IV--PROTECTING CONSUMERS AND INDIVIDUALS THROUGH IMPROVED MITIGATION (Sec. 401) The bill revises the NFIP community rating program to require (currently, allows) FEMA to provide premium credits in communities that protect natural and beneficial floodplain functions.  (Sec. 402) The bill requires a community that participates in NFIP and has been repeatedly flooded to: (1) assess the continuing risks to community areas repeatedly damaged by floods; and (2) develop and implement a publicly available, community-specific plan for mitigating continuing flood risks to such areas. FEMA must, upon request, provide a community with data to assist in preparation of the required plan. In making decisions with respect to awarding mitigation grants under the Act, FEMA may consider the extent to which a community has complied with these requirements and is working to remedy problems with repeatedly flooded areas. A community that does not comply with these requirements shall be subject to sanctions. (Sec. 403) FEMA must make additional coverage available under its Increased Cost of Compliance program. Currently, the program provides coverage to insure the cost of mitigating future flood damage to an NFIP-insured structure that has been substantially or repetitively damaged by floods.  TITLE V--PROGRAM INTEGRITY (Sec. 501) The bill makes FEMA responsible for ensuring NFIP is financially sound. FEMA must commission an annual independent actuarial review of the financial status of NFIP.  (Sec. 502) The premium surcharge amount on flood insurance is changed to: (1) increase annual surcharges for all primary residences, (2) reduce annual surcharges for certain non-owner occupied residential properties, and (3) increase annual surcharges for all other non-primary residences.  (Sec. 503) FEMA must institute a uniform rate of assessment for all policyholders when increasing premiums.  During the phase-in period of the required reserve ratio for the NFIP reserve fund, FEMA must increase the annual assessment by at least one percentage point if the required amount was not collected the previous year.  (Sec. 504) This bill revises NFIP classifications of properties incurring multiple flood losses and coverage for properties that have incurred multiple flood losses. For properties with two flood insurance claims, FEMA must raise premiums by at least 10% annually if the premiums do not reflect full risk. For properties with three or more claims, FEMA must raise premiums by at least 15% annually if the premiums do not reflect full risk.  Certain multiple loss properties are subject to minimum deductibles. FEMA must undertake efforts to validate the accuracy of claim history data. FEMA must deny coverage to a property owner that does not implement flood mitigation measures if the property is an extreme repetitive loss property (a property with cumulative claims that exceed 150% of the maximum coverage amount). Multiple loss properties are not eligible for subsidized premium rates that apply to properties newly mapped into areas with special flood hazards. FEMA must communicate to policyholders the availability of flood mitigation assistance and the effect on premiums of filing further claims for multiple-loss properties.  The bill revises the Flood Mitigation Assistance program, including to make assistance available to additional multiple loss properties. (Sec. 505) This bill eliminates NFIP coverage for properties that prospectively exceed specified lifetime levels of claim payments.  (Sec. 506) The allowance paid to Write Your Own companies is limited to 27.9% of the premium rate. FEMA must reduce the costs to companies participating in the Write Your Own program.  (Sec. 507) This bill amends the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 to increase penalties for violations of the mandatory purchase requirement.  (Sec. 508) If a state allows all-perils policies to cover flood damage, property in that state is not subject to NFIP's mandatory purchase requirement.  (Sec. 509) The bill raises the maximum loan amount for the small loan exception to NFIP's mandatory purchase requirement from $5,000 to $25,000, adjusted for inflation.  A state or local government, or a private lender, may require flood insurance coverage for structures outside a special flood hazard area.  (Sec. 510) FEMA must approve claims under NFIP not later than 120 days after a policyholder submits proof of loss.  (Sec. 511) FEMA must annually cede a portion of the risk from NFIP to private reinsurance or capital markets. FEMA is also required to establish a probable maximum loss target for the program each fiscal year.  (Sec. 512) The GAO must report on options for simplifying NFIP.  (Sec. 513) The GAO must report on the mandatory purchase requirement.  TITLE VI--ADMINISTRATIVE REFORMS (Sec. 601) Fraudulent or false statements in connection with a flood insurance claim under NFIP make a person subject to civil enforcement, penalties, and suspension from the program. The bill directs FEMA to refer evidence of this activity to the Department of Justice. (Sec. 602) FEMA is directed to revise the appeals process for policyholders seeking review of a flood insurance claim denial by their insurer. A decision shall be provided to the policyholder. (Sec. 603) Claims under NFIP must be approved or denied no later than 90 days after the claim is made, with provisions for an extension in extraordinary cases. (Sec. 604) The bill gives FEMA litigation oversight and strategy authority in litigation conducted by Write Your Own companies. (Sec. 605) FEMA may not hire in connection with NFIP any disbarred or suspended attorney. (Sec. 606) FEMA may rely upon technical assistance reports when adjusting claims made under NFIP only if the reports are final and meet professional standards. Technical assistance reports must be made available to policyholders upon request when used in claim determinations. (Sec. 607) Every policy issued under NFIP must include documents describing the type of loss covered, a summary of the costs of the policy, and an explanation of the policy’s parameters. (Sec. 608) FEMA is authorized to credit reserve funds to the National Flood Insurance Fund. (Sec. 609) FEMA is directed to ensure sufficient staff for the Flood Insurance Advocate. (Sec. 610) The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 is amended to exempt from maximum hours requirements any employee who: (1) adjusts or evaluates claims resulting from or relating to a major disaster for at least a minimum weekly amount during the two-year period after the disaster; and (2) is employed as an adjuster or evaluator by an employer not engaged in underwriting, selling, or marketing property, casualty, or liability insurance policies or contracts. ","21st Century Flood Reform Act TITLE I--POLICYHOLDER PROTECTIONS AND INFORMATION (Sec. 101) This bill amends the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 to extend the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) through FY2022.  (Sec. 102) The bill changes annual minimums and limits on premium increases for specified policies subsidized through NFIP to: (1) increase the minimum from 5% to 5.5% for the second year after enactment, (2) increase the minimum from 5% to 6% for the third year, (3) increase ..."
55,hr1,To provide for reconciliation pursuant to title II of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018.,"(This measure has not been amended since the House agreed to the Senate amendment without amendment on December 20, 2017. The summary of that version is repeated here.) This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to reduce tax rates and modify policies, credits, and deductions for individuals and businesses. It also establishes an oil and gas leasing program for the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska.  (Unless otherwise specified, provisions referred to in this summary as temporary or as a suspension of an existing provision apply for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2026.)  TITLE I Subtitle A-- Individual Tax Reform  Part I--Tax Rate Reform  (Sec. 11001) This section temporarily replaces the existing tax brackets (10%, 15%, 25%, 28%, 33%, 35%, and 39.6%) with new brackets (10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% , 37%) and specifies the income levels that apply for each bracket.  The bill also: (1) modifies the taxation of the unearned income of children, and (2) requires the Department of the Treasury to promulgate due diligence requirements for paid preparers in determining eligibility for a taxpayer to file as a head of household.  (Sec. 11002) This section requires the chained Consumer Price Index to be used to index the brackets for inflation.  Part II--Deduction For Qualified Business Income Of Pass-Thru Entities  (Sec. 11011) This section temporarily allows an individual taxpayer to deduct 20% of qualified business income (i.e., business income of an individual from a partnership, S corporation, or sole proprietorship which is currently taxed using individual income tax rates), including aggregate qualified Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) dividends, qualified cooperative dividends, and qualified publicly traded partnership income.  The bill specifies formulas for determining the taxpayer's deduction for qualified business income and for determining the deduction for certain agricultural or horticultural cooperatives.  The deduction applies to taxable income, is not used to calculate adjusted gross income (AGI), and is available to taxpayers who do not itemize deductions. Trusts and estates are eligible for the deduction.  The bill phases in a limitation for the deduction when wages exceed $157,500 ($315,000 in the case of a joint return). The bill also phases in a disallowance of the deduction when taxable income with respect to specified service trades or businesses exceeds the limits. The limits are fully phased in when taxable income exceeds the threshold amounts by $50,000 ($100,000 for joint returns).  A ""specified service trade or business"" is any trade or business involving the performance of services in the fields of health, law, consulting, athletics, financial services, brokerage services, or any trade or business where the principal asset of such trade or business is the reputation or skill of one or more of its employees or owners, or which involves the performance of services that consist of investing and investment management trading, or dealing in securities, partnership interests, or commodities. The term excludes engineering and architecture services.  (Sec. 11012) This section temporarily prohibits taxpayers other than corporations from claiming excess business losses.  An excess business loss for the taxable year is the excess of aggregate deductions of the taxpayer attributable to trades or businesses of the taxpayer (determined without regard to the limitation of the provision), over the sum of aggregate gross income or gain of the taxpayer plus $250,000 (200% of the amount in the case of a joint return). The threshold amount is indexed for inflation after 2018.  In the case of a partnership or S corporation, the provision applies at the partner or shareholder level. Each partner's distributive share and each S corporation shareholder's pro rata share of items of income, gain, deduction, or loss of the partnership or S corporation are taken into account in applying the limitation under the provision for the taxable year of the partner or S corporation shareholder.  Losses prohibited under this section are carried forward and treated as part of the taxpayer's net operating loss carryforward in subsequent taxable years.  Part III--Tax Benefits For Families And Individuals  (Sec. 11021) This section temporarily increases the standard deduction to $24,000 for married individuals filing a joint return, to $18,000 for head-of-household filers, and to $12,000 for all other taxpayers. The amount of the standard deduction is indexed for inflation after 2018 using the chained CPI.  (Under current law, the standard deduction for 2017 is $6,350 for single individuals and married individuals filing separate returns, $9,350 for heads of households, and $12,700 for married individuals filing a joint return and surviving spouses.)  (Sec. 11022) This section modifies the child tax credit to temporarily: (1) increase the credit to $2,000 ($1,000 under current law) per qualifying child under the age of 17, and (2) allow a $500 nonrefundable credit for each dependent of the taxpayer who is not a qualifying child under age 17.  The credit is phased out at AGI levels of $400,000 for married taxpayers filing joint returns and $200,000 for individuals.  The refundable portion of the credit is limited to $1,400 per qualifying child. In order to receive the credit, a taxpayer must include a Social Security number for each qualifying child for whom the credit is claimed on the tax return. The requirement does not apply to a non-child dependent for whom the $500 non-refundable credit is claimed.  (Sec. 11023) This section modifies the deduction for charitable contributions to temporarily increase from 50% to 60% the income-based percentage limitation for contributions of cash to public charities. (Sec. 11024) This section temporarily increases contribution limitations for ABLE accounts with respect to contributions made by the designated beneficiary of the account. (Tax-favored ABLE [Achieving a Better Life Experience] accounts are designed to enable individuals with disabilities to save for and pay for disability-related expenses.)  After the limit is reached, the designated beneficiary may contribute an additional amount up to the lesser of: (1) the federal poverty line for a one-person household, or (2) the individual's compensation for the taxable year.  The bill also allows the designated beneficiary of an ABLE account to claim the saver's credit for contributions made to his or her account.  (Sec. 11025) This section allows funds from qualified tuition programs (known as 529 plans) to be rolled over to an ABLE account without penalty if the ABLE account is owned by the designated beneficiary of the 529 account or a member of the designated beneficiary's family.  (Sec. 11026) This section temporarily allows certain members of the Armed Forces in the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt to receive combat zone tax benefits for performing services that qualify for special pay for duty subject to hostile fire or imminent danger.  (Sec. 11027) For 2017 and 2018, this section reduces from 10% to 7.5% the AGI threshold that must be exceeded before a taxpayer is allowed to claim an itemized deduction for medical expenses.  (Sec. 11028) This section provides tax incentives for areas in which a major disaster was declared by the President under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act during calendar year 2016.  For individuals residing in the 2016 disaster areas, the bill allows: (1) exceptions to the 10% penalty for up to $100,000 in early withdrawals from retirement plans, and (2) personal casualty losses exceeding $500 per casualty to be deducted without regard to whether aggregate net losses exceed 10% of a taxpayer's AGI.  Part IV--Education  (Sec. 11031) This section temporarily modifies the exclusion of student loan discharges from gross income to exclude from gross income certain discharges on account of the death or total and permanent disability of the student.  (Sec. 11032) This section allows funds from 529 accounts to be used for expenses for tuition in connection with enrollment or attendance at an elementary or secondary public, private, or religious school.  Part V--Deductions And Exclusions  (Sec. 11041) This section: (1) suspends the deduction for personal exemptions, (2) modifies the wage withholding rules, (3) and modifies the requirements that determine who is required to file a tax return.  (Sec. 11042) This section temporarily limits individual deductions for certain state and local taxes to $10,000 per year ($5,000 for a married taxpayer filing a separate return). The limit does not apply to taxes paid or accrued in carrying on a trade or business or for expenses for the production of income.  (Sec. 11043) This section modifies the deduction for home mortgage interest to: (1) limit the deduction to mortgages for a principal residence, (2) temporarily limit the deduction for debt incurred on or before December 15, 2017, to mortgages of up to $750,000 (currently $1 million), and (3) suspend the deduction for interest paid on home equity loans.  For taxable years beginning after 2025, the deduction applies to mortgages of up to $1 million regardless of when the indebtedness was incurred.  (Sec. 11044) This section temporarily modifies the deduction for personal casualty and theft losses. A taxpayer may only claim the deduction for a personal casualty loss if the loss is attributable to a federally declared disaster. The bill includes an exception for certain personal casualty losses that do not exceed personal casualty gains.  (Sec. 11045) This section suspends all miscellaneous itemized deductions that are subject to the 2% floor under present law.  (Sec. 11046) This section suspends the overall limitation on itemized deductions, which currently applies when AGI exceeds a specified amount. (Sec. 11047) This section suspends the exclusion for qualified bicycle commuting reimbursements.  (Sec. 11048) This section suspends the exclusion for qualified moving expense reimbursements, with an exception for members of the Armed Forces on active duty who move pursuant to a military order and incident to a permanent change of station. (Sec. 11049) This section suspends the deduction for moving expenses.  (Sec. 11050) This section temporarily modifies a provision that limits the deduction for wagering losses to the extent of the gains from such transactions. The bill specifies that ""losses from wagering transactions"" include otherwise deductible expenses incurred in carrying out a wagering transaction (e.g., expenses for traveling to or from a casino).  (Sec. 11051) This section repeals the deduction for alimony or separate maintenance payments from the payor spouse and the corresponding inclusion of the payments in the gross income of the recipient spouse.  Part VI--Increase In Estate And Gift Tax Exemption  (Sec. 11061) This section doubles the estate and gift tax exemption amount for decedents dying or gifts made after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2026, by increasing the basic exclusion amount from $5 million to $10 million. (Under current law, the amount is indexed for inflation occurring after 2011.)  Part VII--Extension Of Time Limit For Contesting IRS Levy  (Sec. 11071) This section extends from nine months to two years the time limit for contesting an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) levy, including the time periods for: (1) returning the monetary proceeds from the sale of property that has been wrongfully levied upon, and (2) bringing a civil action for a wrongful levy.  Part VIII--Individual Mandate  (Sec. 11081) This section repeals the penalty for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential health coverage as required by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (commonly referred to as the individual mandate).  Subtitle B--Alternative Minimum Tax  (Sec. 12001) This section repeals the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT).  (Sec. 12002) This section modifies the AMT credit for corporations to: (1) allow the AMT credit to offset regular tax liability for any taxable year, and (2) make the credit refundable for any taxable year beginning after 2017 and before 2022 in an amount equal to 50% (100% beginning in 2021) of the excess of the minimum tax credit for the taxable year over the amount of the credit allowable for the year against regular tax liability.  (Under current law a corporation subject to the AMT in any year is allowed an AMT credit in any subsequent taxable year to the extent that the taxpayer's regular tax liability exceeds its tentative minimum tax in the subsequent year.)  (Sec. 12003) This section temporarily increases both the exemption amount and the exemption amount phaseout thresholds for the individual AMT. The exemption amount is increased to $109,400 for married taxpayers filing a joint return (half this amount for married taxpayers filing a separate return), and $70,300 for all other taxpayers (other than estates and trusts). The phaseout thresholds are increased to $1 million for married taxpayers filing a joint return, and $500,000 for all other taxpayers (other than estates and trusts). The amounts are indexed for inflation after 2018. Subtitle C--Business-related Provisions  Part I--Corporate Provisions  (Sec. 13001) This section reduces the corporate tax rate from a maximum of 35% under the existing graduated rate structure to a flat 21% rate for tax years beginning after 2017. The bill specifies requirements for taxpayers subject to the normalization method of accounting.  (Sec. 13002) With respect to the deduction for corporations that receive dividends from other taxable corporations, the bill reduces the 70% dividends received deduction to 50% and the 80% dividends received deduction to 65% to account for the lower corporate tax rate.  Part II--Small Business Reforms  (Sec. 13101) This section expands the expensing of certain depreciable business assets that is currently permitted under section 179 of the IRC.  The bill modifies section 179 to:    increase the maximum amount a taxpayer may expense per year to $1 million (currently $500,000);   increase the phaseout threshold for the cost of section 179 property placed in service during the year to $2.5 million (currently $2 million);   index the amounts above and the existing $25,000 limit for sport utility vehicles for inflation;   revise the definition of qualified real property eligible for section 179 expensing to include any qualified improvement property and certain improvements to nonresidential real property placed in service after the date such property was first placed in service (roofs; heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning property; fire protection and alarm systems; and security systems); and   expand the definition of section 179 property to include certain depreciable tangible personal property used predominantly to furnish lodging or in connection with furnishing lodging.   (Sec. 13102) This section modifies the accounting rules for small businesses to:   expand the group of taxpayers who qualify for the cash accounting method by increasing the limit for the gross receipts test from $5 million to $25 million (adjusted for inflation after 2018),   allow any farming C corporation (or farming partnership with a C corporation partner) that meets the gross receipts test to use the cash method of accounting,   exempt taxpayers that meet the gross receipts test from certain requirements to account for inventories,   expand the exceptions for small businesses from the uniform capitalization rules to include any producer or reseller that meets the gross receipts test, and   expand the exception for small construction contracts from the requirement to use the percentage-of-completion method.   Part III--Cost Recovery And Accounting Methods  Subpart A--Cost Recovery  (Sec. 13201) This section temporarily allows increased expensing of the costs of certain business property.  The bill allows 100% expensing for: (1) certain business property acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017, and before January 1, 2023 (January 1, 2024 for longer production period property and certain aircraft); and (2) specified plants that bear fruits or nuts and are planted or grafted after September 27, 2017, and before January 1, 2023.  The 100% allowance is phased down by 20% per year calendar year for property placed in service, and specified plants planted or grafted, in taxable years beginning after 2022 (after 2023 for longer production period property and certain aircraft).  The bill also:    expands the definition of ""qualified property"" eligible for expensing to include certain film, television, and live theatrical productions;   removes the requirement that the original use of qualified property must commence with the taxpayer, subject to certain acquisition requirements and anti-abuse rules; and   excludes from the definition of ""qualified property"" the property of certain businesses that are not subject to the limitation on interest expenses.   (Sec. 13202) This section increases the depreciation limits that apply to luxury automobiles. It also removes computer or peripheral equipment from the definition of listed property that is subject to additional restrictions and substantiation requirements regarding the expense and business usage of the property.  (Sec. 13203) This section modifies the depreciation rules for certain farm property to: (1) shorten the recovery period from seven to five years for any machinery or equipment (other than any grain bin, cotton ginning asset, fence, or other land improvement) used in a farming business, the original use of which commences with the taxpayer and is placed in service after December 31, 2017; and (2) repeal the requirement to use the 150% declining balance method for property used in a farming business.  (Sec. 13204) This section modifies the applicable recovery periods for depreciating certain real property.  The bill eliminates the separate definitions of qualified leasehold improvement, qualified restaurant, and qualified retail improvement property and applies the straight line method to qualified improvement property. It also modifies the alternative depreciation system (ADS) recovery period for such property.  (Under current law, ""qualified improvement property"" is any improvement to an interior portion of a building which is nonresidential real property if such improvement is placed in service after the date such building was first placed in service. It does not include any improvement for which the expenditure is attributable to: the enlargement of the building, any elevator or escalator, or the internal structural framework of the building.)  A real property trade or business electing out of the limitation on the deduction for interest must use the ADS to depreciate nonresidential real property, residential rental property, and qualified improvement property.  (Sec. 13205) This section requires a farming business electing out of the limitation on the deduction for interest to use the ADS to depreciate any property with a recovery period of 10 years or more.  (Sec. 13206) This section adjusts the amortization rules and schedules for certain research and experimentation expenditures.  (Sec. 13207) This section allows expensing of certain costs of replanting lost or damaged citrus plants lost by reason of casualty.  Subpart B--Accounting Methods  (Sec. 13221) This section revises the rules associated with the timing of the recognition of income.  Part IV--Business-Related Exclusions And Deductions  (Sec. 13301) This section limits the deduction for business interest to the sum of: (1) business interest income for the year, (2) 30% of the adjusted taxable income of the taxpayer for the taxable year, and (3) the floor plan financing interest of the taxpayer for the taxable year.  The amount of any business interest not allowed as a deduction for any year may be carried forward indefinitely, with the exception of partnerships which are subject to additional carryforward rules specified in the bill.  ""Business interest income"" is the amount of interest includible in the gross income of the taxpayer for the taxable year which is properly allocable to a trade or business. It does not include investment income.  ""Floor plan financing interest"" is interest paid on debt used to finance the acquisition of motor vehicles held for sale or lease and secured by the inventory so acquired.  The bill includes exceptions for:    small businesses that meet the gross receipts test,   the trade or business of performing services as an employee,   any electing farming business,   any electing real property trade or business, and   certain regulated public utilities.   (Sec. 13302) This section modifies the net operating loss deduction to: (1) limit the deduction to 80% of taxable income with an exception for property and casualty insurance companies, (2) repeal the two-year and other specified carryback provisions, (3) allow an indefinite carryforward of net operating losses, and (4) allow a two-year carryback for certain losses incurred in the trade or business of farming.  (Sec. 13303) This section modifies the rule providing for the nonrecognition of gain in the case of like-kind exchanges to limit the application of the rule to real property that is not held primarily for sale.  (Sec. 13304) This section modifies the tax treatment of certain expenses for entertainment and fringe benefits.  The bill denies deductions for amounts paid or incurred for:    an activity generally considered to be entertainment, amusement or recreation;   membership dues for any club organized for business, pleasure, recreation, or other social purposes;   a facility or portion thereof used in connection with any of the above items;   providing any qualified transportation fringe to employees of the taxpayer; or   providing transportation for commuting between the employee's residence and place of employment, except as necessary for ensuring the safety of the employee.   Under current law, taxpayers may deduct 50% of the food and beverage expenses associated with operating their trade or business, subject to certain exceptions. The bill temporarily expands the 50% limitation to include expenses of an employer associated with providing food and beverages through an eating facility that meets the requirements for a de minimis fringe.  (Sec. 13305) This section repeals the deduction for income attributable to domestic production activities.  (Sec. 13306) This section prohibits deductions for trade or business expenses for any amount paid or incurred (whether by suit, agreement, or otherwise) to, or at the direction of, a government or governmental entity in relation to the violation of any law or the investigation or inquiry by such government or entity into the potential violation of any law.  The bill includes exceptions for amounts constituting restitution or paid to come into compliance with law, amounts paid or incurred as a result of certain court orders, and taxes due.  The bill also establishes reporting requirements for government entities with respect to certain fines, penalties, and other amounts.  (Sec. 13307) This section prohibits a tax deduction for trade or business expenses paid or incurred for: (1) any settlement or payment related to sexual harassment or sexual abuse if such settlement or payment is subject to a nondisclosure agreement, or (2) attorney's fees related to such a settlement or payment.  (Sec. 13308) This section eliminates the deduction for lobbying expenditures to influence the legislation of any local council or similar governing body, including an Indian tribal government.  (Sec. 13309) This section requires a three-year holding period (one year under current law) for certain net long-term capital gains with respect to partnership interests held in connection with the performance of investment services. If the holder of an applicable partnership interest is allocated gain from the sale of property held for less than three years, that gain is treated as short-term capital gain and is taxed as ordinary income.  (Sec. 13310) This section prohibits cash, gift cards, and other non-tangible personal property from being considered tax deductible employee achievement awards.  (Under current law, tangible personal property may be considered a deductible employee achievement award if other specified requirements are met.) The bill specifies that ""tangible personal property"" does not include: (1) cash, cash equivalents, gift cards, gift coupons, or gift certificates (other than arrangements conferring only the right to select and receive tangible personal property from a limited array of such items pre-selected or pre-approved by the employer); or (2) vacations, meals, lodging, tickets to theater or sporting events, stocks, bonds, other securities, and other similar items.  (Sec. 13311) This section eliminates the deduction for living expenses incurred by Members of Congress. (Under current law, the deduction is limited to $3,000 per year.)  (Sec. 13312) This section modifies the exclusion from gross income for contributions to the capital of a corporation to specify that a contribution to capital does not include a contribution: (1) in aid of construction or any other contribution as a customer or potential customer, or (2) by any governmental entity or civic group (other than a contribution made by a shareholder as such).  The bill includes an exception for certain contributions made by a governmental entity pursuant to a master development plan.  (Sec. 13313) This section repeals a provision that permits the tax-free rollover of certain gains from the sale of publicly traded securities into common stock or a partnership interest in a specialized small business investment company.  (Sec. 13314) This section excludes certain patents, inventions, models, designs, secret formulas, or processes created by the taxpayer from the definition of a ''capital asset.''  Part V--Business Credits  (Sec. 13401) This section modifies the tax credit for clinical testing expenses incurred in testing certain drugs for rare diseases or conditions (commonly referred to as orphan drugs) to reduce the credit rate to 25% (currently 50%) of qualified clinical testing expenses.  (Sec. 13402) This section modifies the tax credit for rehabilitation expenditures to repeal the 10% credit for rehabilitated buildings other than a certified historic structure.  The bill retains and modifies the 20% credit for rehabilitation expenditures for certified historic structures. For the five-year period beginning in the year in which a qualified rehabilitated building is placed in service, the credit is equal to the ratable share for each year, which is 20% of the qualified rehabilitation expenditures with respect to the building, as allocated ratably to each year during the period.  (Sec. 13403) This section allows employers to claim a general business credit equal to 12.5% of wages paid to employees during any period in which such employees are on family and medical leave if the rate of payment under the program is 50% of the wages normally paid to an employee.  The credit is increased by 0.25% (but not above 25%) for each percentage point by which the rate of payment exceeds 50%. The maximum amount of family and medical leave that may be taken into account with respect to any employee for any taxable year is 12 weeks.  (Sec. 13404) This section repeals the authority to issue tax-credit bonds and direct-pay bonds.  Part VI--Provisions Related To Specific Entities And Industries  Subpart A--Partnership Provisions  (Sec. 13501) This section sets forth requirements for the tax treatment of gains or losses of foreign persons from the sale or exchange of interests in partnerships engaged in trade or business within the United States.  Under the bill, gain or loss from the sale or exchange of a partnership interest is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business to the extent that the transferor would have had effectively connected gain or loss had the partnership sold all of its assets at fair market value as of the date of the sale or exchange.  A partner's distributive share of gain or loss on the deemed sale must be determined in the same manner as the partner's distributive share of the non-separately stated taxable income or loss of the partnership.  The bill also sets forth withholding requirements with respect to amounts realized from the sale or exchange of a partnership interest.  (Sec. 13502) This section modifies the definition of ""substantial built-in loss"" with respect to the transfer of an interest in partnership. The bill specifies that ""a substantial built-in loss"" also exists if the transferee partner would be allocated a loss of more than $250,000 if the partnership assets were sold for cash equal to their fair market value immediately after such transfer.  (Sec. 13503) This section modifies the basis limitation on a partner's distributive share of a partnership loss to require a partner's distributive share of partnership charitable contribution and taxes paid or accrued to foreign countries and U.S. possessions to be taken into account in determining the limitation.  (Sec. 13504) This section repeals the rule that provides for a technical termination of partnerships if, within any 12-month period, there is a sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total interest in partnership capital and profits.  Subpart B--Insurance Reforms  (Sec. 13511) This section repeals the operations loss deduction for life insurance companies and allows the net operating loss deduction under section 172 of the IRC.  (Sec. 13512) This section repeals the small life insurance company deduction.  (Sec. 13513) This section revises the tax treatment of income or loss resulting from a change in the method of computing life insurance company reserves. The bill eliminates the 10-year period for taking into account the changes and requires the changes to be taken into account as adjustments attributable to a change in the method of accounting.  (Sec. 13514) This section repeals the special rule for distributions to shareholders of a stock life insurance company from a pre-1984 policyholders surplus account, which provides that amounts in the account are not taxed unless the amounts are treated as distributed to shareholders or subtracted from the account. The bill requires a life insurance company with such an account to pay taxes on the balance of the account ratably over the first eight taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017.  (Sec. 13515) This section modifies the proration rules for property and casualty insurance companies to replace the 15% reduction with a reduction equal to 5.25% divided by the highest corporate tax rate in effect. (Under the top corporate rate of 21% that takes effect in 2018, the proration percentage is 25%.)  (Under the proration rules, in calculating the deductible amount of its reserve for losses incurred, a property or casualty insurance company must reduce the amount of the losses incurred by a specified percentage of: (1) the insurer's tax-exempt interest, (2) the deductible portion of dividends received, and (3) the increase for the taxable year in the cash value of life insurance, endowment, or annuity contracts the company owns.)  (Sec. 13516) This section repeals the special estimated tax payment rules for insurance companies.  (Sec. 13517) This section modifies the rules for computing life insurance tax reserves that are used in determining the taxable income of a life insurance company.  (Sec. 13518) This section modifies the life insurance company proration rule for reducing dividends received deductions and reserve deductions with respect to untaxed income. For purposes of the life insurance proration rule, the company's share is 70% and the policyholder's share is 30%.  (Sec. 13519) This section modifies the requirements for the capitalization of policy acquisition expenses of insurance companies to extend the amortization period from 120 months to 180 months.  Under current law, policy acquisition expenses are determined as that portion of the insurance company's general deductions for the taxable year that does not exceed a specified percentage of the net premiums for the year on each of three categories of insurance contracts.  The bill increases these percentages from 1.75% to 2.09% for annuity contracts, from 2.05% to 2.45% for group life insurance contracts, and from 7.7% to 9.2% for all other specified insurance contracts.  (Sec. 13520) This section establishes reporting requirements for acquisitions of life insurance contracts in a reportable policy sale. It also imposes reporting requirements on the payor in the case of the payment of reportable death benefits.  A ""reportable policy sale"" is the acquisition of an interest in a life insurance contract, directly or indirectly, if the acquirer has no substantial family, business, or financial relationship with the insured apart from the acquirer's interest in such life insurance contract.  (Sec. 13521) This section sets forth requirements for the determining the basis of a life insurance or annuity contract. The bill specifies that no basis adjustment shall be made for mortality, expense, or other reasonable charges incurred under an annuity or life insurance contract.  (Sec. 13522) This section exempts the transfer of a life insurance contract, or any interest therein, in a reportable policy sale from the transfer for valuable consideration rule.  (Under current law, the transfer for valuable consideration rule provides that, if a life insurance contract or an interest in a contract is transferred for a valuable consideration, the tax exclusion for amounts received under a life insurance contract due to the death of the insured is limited to the sum of the actual value of the consideration and the premiums and other amounts subsequently paid by the transferee.)  (Sec. 13523) This section modifies the reserve discounting rules applicable to property and casualty insurance companies to: (1) modify the interest rate used to discount unpaid losses, (2) modify the computational rules for loss payment pattern, and (3) repeal the election to use a taxpayer's historical loss payment pattern.  Subpart C--Banks and Financial Instruments  (Sec. 13531) This section limits the deduction for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation premiums for certain financial institutions with consolidated assets that exceed $10 billion.  (Sec. 13532) This section repeals the exclusion from gross income for interest on a bond issued to advance refund another bond.  Subpart D--S Corporations  (Sec. 13541) This section allows a nonresident alien individual to be a qualifying beneficiary of an electing small business trust (ESBT), which is a type of trust that is permitted to hold shares in an S corporation.  (Sec. 13542) This section specifies that the charitable contribution deduction of an ESBT is determined by the rules applicable to individuals rather than the rules applicable to trusts, except that the deductions for costs which are paid or incurred in connection with the administration of the trust and which would not have been incurred if the property were not held in such trust shall be treated as allowable in arriving at adjusted gross income.  (Sec. 13543) This section modifies the tax treatment of S corporation conversions to C corporations.  Part VII--Employment  Subpart A--Compensation  (Sec. 13601) This section modifies a provision that limits the deduction for compensation of covered employees of a publicly held corporation to salaries of no more than $1 million per year. The bill: (1) repeals the performance-based compensation and commission exceptions, (2) modifies the definition of ""covered employee,"" and (3) expands the definition of ""publicly held corporation.""  The bill includes an exception for compensation that is provided pursuant to a written binding contract which was in effect on November 2, 2017, and which was not modified in any material respect on or after such date.  (Sec. 13602) This section imposes an excise tax on excess tax-exempt organization executive compensation. The tax is equal to the product of the corporate tax rate (21% under this bill) and the sum of: (1) any remuneration (other than an excess parachute payment) in excess of $1 million paid to a covered employee by an applicable tax-exempt organization for a taxable year, and (2) any excess parachute payment (separation pay), as specified in the bill.  (Sec. 13603) This section allows qualified employees to elect to defer, for income tax purposes, income attributable to certain stock transferred to the employee by an employer.  Employees are excluded if they: (1) are a 1% owner, the chief executive officer, or the chief financial officer of the corporation or have been at any time during the 10 preceding calendar years; (2) are a family member of the specified individuals; or (3) is one of the four highest compensated officers of the corporation or has been during any of the 10 preceding taxable years.  (Sec. 13604) This section increases from 15% to 20% the excise tax imposed on the value of stock compensation held by insiders of an expatriated corporation.  Subpart B--Retirement Plans  (Sec. 13611) This section repeals the rule that allows Individual Retirement Arrangement (IRA) contributions to one type of IRA (traditional or Roth) to be recharacterized as a contribution to the other type of IRA.  (Sec. 13612) This section increases the limit on accruals that is required for length of service award plans (LOSAPs) for bona fide volunteers to be exempt from treatment as a deferred compensation plan.  (Under current law, plans paying solely length of service awards to bona fide volunteers or their beneficiaries on the account of firefighting and prevention services, emergency medical services, and ambulance services performed by the volunteers are not treated as deferred compensation plans if they meet certain requirements. One of the requirements is a limit on the aggregate amount of length of service awards that may accrue with respect to any year of service for any bona fide volunteer.)  The bill modifies the limit on accruals to: (1) increase the limit from $3,000 to $6,000; and(2) provide for a cost-of-living adjustment to the limit after 2017.  In the case of LOSAPs that are defined benefit plans, the limit applies to the actuarial present value of the aggregate amount of length of service awards accruing with respect to any year of service. Actuarial present value is to be calculated using reasonable actuarial assumptions and methods, assuming payment will be made under the most valuable form of payment under the plan with payment commencing at the later of the earliest age at which unreduced benefits are payable under the plan or the participant's age at the time of the calculation.  (Sec. 13613) This section extends the period during which a qualified plan loan offset amount may be contributed to an eligible retirement plan as a rollover contribution. A ""qualified plan loan offset amount"" is a plan loan offset amount that is treated as distributed from a qualified retirement plan, a section 403(b) plan or a governmental section 457(b) plan solely by reason of the termination of the plan or the failure to meet the repayment terms of the loan because of the severance from employment of the participant.  Part VIII--Exempt Organizations  (Sec. 13701) This section imposes a 1.4% excise tax on the net investment income of certain private colleges and universities.  (Sec. 13702) This section requires tax-exempt organizations with more than one unrelated trade or business to calculate unrelated business taxable income separately with respect to each trade or business and without regard to a specified deduction that applies for certain unrelated business taxable income.  (Sec. 13703) This section includes in unrelated business taxable income of a tax-exempt organization any expenses paid or incurred by the organization for certain fringe benefits for which a deduction is not allowed under section 274 of the IRC, including qualified transportation fringe benefits, a parking facility used in connection with qualified parking, or any on-premises athletic facility.  (Sec. 13704) This section modifies the deduction for charitable contributions to prohibit a charitable deduction for college athletic event seating rights.  (Sec. 13705) This section modifies the deduction for charitable contributions to repeal the exception to substantiation requirements for certain contributions reported by the donee organization.  Part IX--Other Provisions  Subpart A--Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform  (Sec. 13801) This section excludes the aging periods for beer, wine, and distilled spirits from the production period for purposes of the uniform interest capitalization rules, which allows the producers to deduct interest expenses attributable to a shorter production period. This section does not apply to interest costs paid or accrued after December 31, 2019.  (Sec. 13802) This section lowers the excise tax rate on beer to $16 per barrel on the first six million barrels brewed by the brewer or imported by the importer.  For barrels of beer that have been brewed or produced outside of the United States and imported into the United States, the reduced tax rate may be assigned by the brewer to the importer, subject to specified requirements.  (Sec. 13803) This section allows the transfer of beer between bonded facilities without payment of tax if specified requirements are met.  (Sec. 13804) This section modifies the credit against the excise tax on wine for small domestic for 2018 and 2019 to:    make the credit available to all wine producers and importers by removing the 250,000 wine gallon domestic production limitation;  establish credit rates of: (1) $1.00 per wine gallon for the first 30,000 wine gallons of wine, plus; (2) 90 cents per wine gallon on the next 100,000 wine gallons of wine, plus; (3) 53.5 cents per wine gallon on the next 620,000 wine gallons of wine;   establish adjusted credit rates for hard cider; and   make sparkling wine producers and importers eligible for the credit.   The bill also allows importers of wine produced outside of the United States to assign the credit to the foreign producer, subject to specified requirements.  (Sec. 13805) The section modifies the alcohol-by-volume levels of the first two tiers of the excise tax on wine, by changing 14% to 16%. Under the provision, a wine producer or importer may produce or import still wine that has an alcohol-by-volume level of up to 16% and remain subject to the lowest rate of $1.07 per wine gallon.  (Sec. 13806) This section specifies definitions for ""mead"" and ""low alcohol by volume wine"" that are eligible to be taxed at the lowest applicable rate for still wine.  (Sec. 13807) This section reduces the excise tax rate for certain distilled spirits in 2018 and 2019 to: $2.70 per proof gallon on the first 100,000 proof gallons, $13.34 for all proof gallons in excess of that amount but below 22,130,000 proof gallons, and $13.50 for amounts thereafter.  Members of the same controlled group may not receive the lower rate on more than 100,000 proof gallons of distilled spirits. Importers of distilled spirits are eligible for the lower rates.  (Sec. 13808) This section allows distillers to transfer spirits in approved containers other than bulk containers in bond without payment of tax. This provision applies to distilled spirits transferred in bond after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2020.  Subpart B--Miscellaneous Provisions  (Sec. 13821) This section modifies the tax treatment of Alaska Native Settlement Trusts, to: (1) allow an Alaska Native Corporation to assign certain payments referenced in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act to a trust without including the payments in the gross income of the corporation, (2) allow the corporation to elect annually to deduct contributions made to a trust, (3) allow a trust to elect to defer the recognition of gains related to contributions of property other than cash until the sale or exchange of the property, and (4) establish information reporting requirements for deductible contributions to a trust.  (Sec. 13822) This section exempts certain payments related to the management of private aircraft from the excise taxes imposed on taxable transportation by air.  (Sec. 13823) This section authorizes the designation of opportunity zones in low-income communities and provides various tax incentives for investments in the zones. Taxpayers may temporarily defer the recognition of capital gains that are invested in opportunity zones. Investments in opportunity zones or opportunity funds that are held for at least five years are eligible for capital gains tax reductions or exemptions, depending on how long the investment is held.  Subtitle D--International Tax Provisions  Under current law, the earnings of foreign subsidiaries of U.S. multinational corporations are not taxed until the income is repatriated (paid as dividends) into the United States. The corporations are allowed a tax credit against U.S. taxes for taxes paid to foreign jurisdictions. This subtitle establishes a territorial system in which foreign source income is not subject to regular U.S. taxes.  Part I--Outbound Transactions  Subpart A--Establishment of Participation Exemption System for Taxation of Foreign Income  (Sec. 14101) This section establishes a participation exemption system for foreign income. Under the system, the bill allows a 100% deduction for the foreign-source portion of dividends received from specified 10% owned foreign corporations by domestic corporations that are U.S. shareholders of those foreign corporations.  A ""specified 10% owned foreign corporation"" is any foreign corporation with respect to which any domestic corporation is a U.S. shareholder. It does not include a passive foreign investment company that is not a controlled foreign corporation (CFC).  No foreign tax credit or deduction is allowed for any taxes paid or accrued with respect to any dividend for which a deduction is allowed under this section.  The bill establishes a one-year holding period requirement for dividends of a domestic corporation to be eligible for a participation dividends received deduction.  (Sec. 14102) This section sets forth requirements for the tax treatment of sales or transfers involving specified 10% owned foreign corporations, including (1) sales by U.S. persons of stock, (2) required reductions in the basis of certain foreign stock, and (3) sales by a CFC of a lower-tier CFC, (4) foreign branch loess transferred to specified 10% owned foreign corporations, and (5) the repeal of the active trade or business exception.  (Sec. 14103) This section specifies rules for the tax treatment of deferred foreign income upon transition to the participation exemption system of taxation.  For the last taxable year of a deferred foreign income corporation which begins before January 1, 2018, U.S. shareholders of deferred foreign income corporations must include as subpart F income a pro rata share of the accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income of the corporation.  The bill allows a deduction for a portion of the pro rata share of foreign earnings. The bill also disallows a corresponding portion of the credit for foreign taxes.  The total amount of deductions permitted is the amount necessary to result in tax rates of 15.5% for accumulated post-1986 foreign earnings held in the form of cash or cash equivalents and 8% rate for all other earnings.  The tax may be paid in installments over eight years.  The bill specifies rules for applying this provision to S corporations and real estate investment trusts.  Subpart B--Rules Related to Passive and Mobile Income  Chapter 1--Taxation Of Foreign-Derived Intangible Income And Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income  (Sec. 14201) This section requires a U.S. shareholder of any CFC for any taxable year to include in gross income the shareholder's global intangible low-taxed income for the year. The bill specifies a formula and requirements for calculating global intangible low-taxed income.  (Sec. 14202) This section allows deductions for domestic corporations for specified portions of the corporation's foreign-derived intangible income and global intangible low-taxed income, using specified formulas and definitions included in the bill.  Chapter 2--Other Modifications Of Subpart F Provisions  (Sec. 14211) This section repeals provisions that treat foreign base company oil related income as category of subpart F income.  (Sec. 14212) This section repeals the requirement for a U.S. shareholder in a CFC that invested previously excluded subpart F income in foreign base company shipping operations to include in income a pro rata share of the previously excluded subpart F income when the CFC decreases the investments  (Sec. 14213) This section modifies the stock attribution rules for determining status as a CFC. Certain stock of a foreign corporation owned by a foreign person must be attributed to a related U.S. person for purposes of determining whether the related U.S. person is a U.S. shareholder of the foreign corporation.  (Sec. 14214) This section expands the definition of U.S. shareholder under subpart F to include any U.S. person who owns 10% or more of the total value of shares of all classes of stock of a foreign corporation.  (Sec. 14215) This section eliminates the requirement for a corporation to be controlled for an uninterrupted period of 30 days before subpart F inclusions apply.  Chapter 3--Prevention Of Base Erosion  (Sec. 14221) This section modifies terms and valuation methods that apply to transfers of intangible property. The bill modifies the definition of ""intangible property"" to include: (1) any goodwill, going concern value, or workforce in place (including its composition and terms and conditions [contractual or otherwise] of its employment); or (2) any other item the value or potential value of which is not attributable to tangible property or the services of any individual.  The bill removes a requirement that the item have substantial value independent of the services of an individual to be considered intangible property.  The bill specifies authorities and requirements for Treasury to specify the method to be used to determine the valuation of transfers of intangible property.  (Sec. 14222) This section denies a deduction for any disqualified related party amount paid or accrued pursuant to a hybrid transaction or by, or to, a hybrid entity.  A ""disqualified related party amount"" is any interest or royalty paid or accrued to a related party to the extent that: (1) the amount is not included in the income of such related party under the tax law of the country of which such related party is a resident for tax purposes or is subject to tax, or (2) the related party is allowed a deduction with respect to such amount under the tax law of such country. The term does include any payment to the extent such payment is included in the gross income of a U.S. shareholder under this bill.  A ""hybrid transaction"" is any transaction, series of transactions, agreement, or instrument one or more payments with respect to which are treated as interest or royalties under this bill and which are not so treated for purposes the tax law of the foreign country of which the recipient of such payment is resident for tax purposes or is subject to tax.  A ""hybrid entity"" is any entity which is either: (1) treated as fiscally transparent under this bill but not for the purposes of the tax law of the foreign country of which the entity is a resident for tax purposes or is subject to tax, or (2) treated as fiscally transparent for purposes of such tax law but not so treated for purposes of this bill  (Sec. 14223) Shareholders who receive dividends from a foreign corporation that first becomes a surrogate corporation after enactment of this bill are ineligible for the reduced rates for qualified dividends.  Subpart C--Modifications Related to Foreign Tax Credit System  (Sec. 14301) This section repeals the deemed-paid credit with respect to dividends received by a domestic corporation that owns 10% or more of the voting stock of a foreign corporation. The bill allows a deemed-paid credit with respect to any income inclusion under subpart F. The credit is limited to the amount of foreign income taxes properly attributable to the subpart F inclusion.  (Sec. 14302) This section requires foreign branch income to be allocated to a specific foreign tax credit basket. Foreign branch income is the business profits of a U.S. person which are attributable to one or more qualified business units in one or more foreign countries.  (Sec. 14303) This section requires gains, profits, and income from the sale or exchange of inventory property produced partly in, and partly outside, the United States to be allocated and apportioned between sources within and without the United States solely on the basis of the production activities with respect to the property.  (Sec. 14304) This section allows an election to increase the percentage (but not greater than 100%) of domestic taxable income offset by any pre-2018 unused overall domestic loss and recharacterized as foreign source.  A ""Pre-2018 unused overall domestic loss'' is any overall domestic loss which: (1) arises in a qualified taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018, and (2) has not been used under the general rule for the recharacterization of overall domestic loss.  Part II--Inbound Transactions  (Sec. 14401) This section imposes on each applicable taxpayer for any taxable year a tax equal to the base erosion minimum tax amount for the taxable year and specifies a formula for calculating the tax.  An ""applicable taxpayer"" is a taxpayer who: (1) is a corporation other than a regulated investment company, a real estate investment trust, or an S corporation; (2) has average annual gross receipts of at least $500 million for the three-year period ending with the preceding year; and (3) has a base erosion percentage, as determined using a specified formula, of at least 3% (2% for certain banks and securities dealers).  Part III--Other Provisions  (Sec. 14501) This section modifies the exception from the passive foreign investment company rules for insurance businesses. The bill replaces the test based on whether a corporation is predominantly engaged in an insurance business with a test based on the corporation's insurance liabilities.  (Sec. 14502) This section specifies that all allocations and apportionments of interest expense must be determined using the adjusted bases of assets rather than on the basis of the fair market value of the assets or gross income.  TITLE II  (Sec. 20001) The Department of the Interior must establish and administer a competitive oil and gas program for the leasing, development, production, and transportation of oil and gas in and from the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska.  The bill specifies that the provision in the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act that prohibits the production of oil and gas from ANWR does not apply to the Coastal Plain. Interior must conduct at least two lease sales within 10 years. Each lease sale must contain: (1) at least 400,000 acres, and (2) areas that have the highest potential for the discovery of hydrocarbons.  Interior must also: (1) issue any necessary rights-of-way or easements across the Coastal Plain for the exploration, development, production, or transportation associated with the oil and gas program; and (2) authorize up to 2,000 surface acres of federal land on the Coastal Plain to be covered by production and support facilities during the term of the leases under the oil and gas program.  (Sec. 20002) This section amends the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 to temporarily increase the annual limitation on offshore revenue sharing for the states of Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas from $500 million annually for FY2020 and FY2021, to $650 million annually for those two years.  (Sec. 20003) The Department of Energy (DOE) must: (1) draw down and sell seven million barrels of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve during FY2026-FY2027, (2) deposit the amounts received from the sale in the Treasury, and (3) stop the drawdown or sale of crude oil after $600 million has been deposited in the Treasury.  DOE may not drawdown or sell oil under this section in quantity that would limit the authority to direct a drawdown and sale of petroleum products to address a domestic or international energy supply shortage. ","(This measure has not been amended since the House agreed to the Senate amendment without amendment on December 20, 2017. The summary of that version is repeated here.) This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to reduce tax rates and modify policies, credits, and deductions for individuals and businesses.

Subdivision 2--Tax Relief and Medicaid Changes Relating To Certain Disasters  TITLE I--CALIFORNIA FIRES  This title amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow various tax credits, deductions, and modifications to existing rules for individuals and businesses affected by wildfires in California.  (Sec. 20101) A ""California wildfire disaster zone"" is the portion of the California wildfire disaster area determined by the President to warrant federal assistance under the Stafford Act by reason of wildfires in California.  A ""California wildfire disaster area"" is an area with respect to which between January 1, 2017, through January 18, 2018, a major disaster has been declared by the President under the Stafford Act by reason of wildfires in California.  (Sec. 20102) This section waives the 10% additional tax on early distributions from retirement plans for up to $100,000 in qualified wildfire distributions.  A ""qualified wildfire distribution"" must be made on or after October 8, 2017, and before January 1, 2019, to an individual: (1) whose principal place of abode during any portion of the period from October 8, 2017, to December 31, 2017, is located in the California wildfire disaster area, and (2) who has sustained an economic loss by reason of the wildfires to which the declaration of the area relates.  A taxpayer who has received such a distribution may: (1) repay the distribution by making additional contributions to a retirement account within three years, and (2) include the distribution in gross income by dividing the amount over a three-year period.  This section also: (1) permits individuals to recontribute funds to retirement plans if the funds were distributed for a home purchase in a California wildfire disaster area that was cancelled on account of the wildfires, and (2) increases the limit and extends the repayment deadline for loans from retirement plans.  (Sec. 20103) This section allow an employee retention tax credit for employers affected by the California wildfires. The credit is equal to 40% of the qualified wages (up to $6,000 per employee) paid to an employee whose principal place of employment on October 8, 2017, with the employer was in the California wildfire disaster zone.  ""Qualified wages"" include wages that: (1) are paid or incurred on or after October 8, 2017, and before January 1, 2018; and (2) occurred during the period that begins when the trade or business became inoperable at the principal place of employment of the employee immediately before the wildfires and ends when the trade or business has resumed significant operations.  (Sec. 20104) The section modifies the deduction for charitable contributions to temporarily suspend the limitations on charitable contributions made during the period beginning on October 8, 2017, and ending on December 31, 2018, for relief efforts in the California wildfire disaster area.  The section also modifies the deduction for personal casualty losses in the California wildfire disaster areas to eliminate: (1) the requirement for losses to exceed 10% of adjusted gross income to qualify for the deduction, and (2) the requirement to itemize.  For the purposes of determining earned income for the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit, certain taxpayers affected by the California wildfires may use earned income from the immediately preceding year.  TITLE II--TAX RELIEF FOR HURRICANES HARVEY, IRMA, AND MARIA  (Sec. 20201) This title amends the Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2017 to modify the Hurricanes Harvey and Irma Disaster Areas to include areas with respect to which a major disaster has been declared by the President before October 17, 2017 (before September 21, 2017, under current law) under the Stafford Act by reasons of Hurricanes Harvey or Irma.  TITLE III--HURRICANE MARIA RELIEF FOR PUERTO RICO AND THE VIRGIN ISLANDS MEDICAID PROGRAMS  (Sec. 20301) This title increases Medicaid funding for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands through FY2019. Such funding shall be further increased through 2019 for each territory if the territory takes specified actions to improve its Medicaid program. The division also increases the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) for the additional funds to 100%.  TITLE IV--BUDGETARY EFFECTS  (Sec. 20401) This section designates this subdivision as an emergency requirement pursuant to the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) Act of 2010. (This prohibits the budgetary effects of this subdivision from being counted for the purpose of PAYGO rules that prohibit certain revenue and direct spending legislation from increasing the deficit.)  (Sec. 20402) In the Senate, this subdivision is designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to the FY2018 congressional budget resolution. (Emergency spending is exempt from discretionary spending limits and other budget enforcement rules.)  Subdivision 3--Further Extension of Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018  Further Extension of Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018  (Sec. 20101) This subdivision amends the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 to provide continuing FY2018 appropriations to federal agencies through March 23, 2018 (February 8, 2018, under current law).  It ends the government shutdown that began when the existing continuing resolution (CR) expired because the FY2018 appropriations bills have not been enacted.  The subdivision also:   continues funding authority to maintain the schedule and deliver the required data according to statutory deadlines in the 2020 Decennial Census Program,  makes additional funding available for the Southeastern Power Administration,  permits the Department of Energy to draw down and sell up to $350 million of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) during FY2018 and requires the proceeds to be used for the SPR modernization program,  makes additional funding available to the judiciary for juror fees,  provides additional funding for the staffing of newly opened or expanded Indian Health Service facilities,  continues Department of Education authority to make account maintenance fee payments to guaranty agencies under the Federal Family Education Loan program,  modifies existing authority to allow the Department of Education to waive cohort default rate requirements for public institutions of higher education operating in economically distressed counties,  provides authority for new construction starts for projects associated with the DOD F-35A Joint Strike Fighter program,  makes technical corrections related to the authority of the Department of Transportation to consolidate its credit programs, and  extends HUD's HOPE VI program for the duration of the CR.

DIVISION C--BUDGETARY AND OTHER MATTERS  TITLE I--BUDGET ENFORCEMENT  (Sec. 30101) This title amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 to increase the defense and nondefense discretionary spending limits for FY2018 and FY2019.  The title revises procedures for implementing the sequester of direct spending, which is required under current law and involves cuts that interact with discretionary spending levels. The title requires the sequester to take place in FY2018 and FY2019 as if the amendments that this title makes to the discretionary spending limits have not been made.  It also extends the sequester for mandatory spending through FY2027 (currently through FY2025) and adjusts the cuts required for Medicare.  (Direct spending, also known as mandatory spending, is spending provided by laws other than appropriations bills. Sequestration is a process of automatic, usually across-the-board spending reductions under which budgetary resources are permanently cancelled to enforce specific budget policy goals.)  (Sec. 30102) This section resets the balances on the scorecards established by the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (PAYGO) to zero.  (Sec. 30103) After April 15, 2018, but not later than May 15, 2018, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee must file committee allocations, aggregate spending and revenue levels, and levels of Social Security revenues and outlays consistent with this bill. The chairman may also include the deficit neutral reserve funds contained in the FY2018 budget resolution updated by one fiscal year.  After April 15, 2018, the allocations, aggregates, and levels submitted by the chairman are enforceable in the Senate as if they were included in a FY2019 congressional budget resolution.  This section expires if Congress agrees to a budget resolution for FY2019.  (Sec. 30104) After April 15, 2018, but not later than May 15, 2018, the chairman of the House Budget Committee must submit for publication in the Congressional Record committee allocations, aggregate spending levels, and aggregate revenue levels consistent with this bill.  If a FY2019 congressional budget resolution has not been adopted by April 15, 2018, the allocations, aggregates, and levels submitted by the chairman are enforceable in the House of Representatives as if they were included in a FY2019 congressional budget resolution.  The chairman may adjust the levels to reflect the budgetary effects of any legislation enacted during the 115th Congress that reduces the deficit or as otherwise necessary.  This section expires if Congress agrees to a budget resolution for FY2019.  (Sec. 30105) This section specifies that section 30103 and section 30104 are enacted under the rulemaking powers of the Senate and the House of Representatives and will be considered part of the rules of each chamber. It also recognizes that each chamber has the authority to change the rules.  TITLE II--OFFSETS  (Sec. 30201) This section amends the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 to extend the authority of Treasury to collect certain customs user fees.  It also amends the United States--Korea Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act to extend the increased rate for merchandise processing fees.  (Sec. 30202) This section extends the requirement for DOT to deposit into the Treasury a portion of the aviation security service fees charged to passengers of air carriers.  (Sec. 30203) This section amends the Immigration and Nationality Act and the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act to extend certain immigration fees for: (1) using the Electronic System for Travel Authorization to travel to the United States under the Visa Waiver Program, and (2) L-1 (intracompany transferees) and H-1B visas (temporary workers in professions specialty occupations).  (Sec. 30204) DOE must draw down and sell specified oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) during FY2022-FY2025, FY2026, and FY2027 and deposit the proceeds in the Treasury during the fiscal year in which the sale occurs.  DOE may not draw down and sell crude oil under this section in quantities that would limit the authority to sell petroleum products under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act in order to prevent or reduce adverse impacts of severe domestic energy supply interruptions.  This section amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to: (1) modify the conditions for a drawdown for the SPR to require DOE to find that the action will not impair the ability of the U.S. to carry out U.S. obligations under the international energy program, and (2) prohibit a draw down when there are fewer than 450 million (currently 350 million) barrels of petroleum product stored in the SPR.  (Sec. 30205) This section amends the Federal Reserve Act to reduce the limit on the aggregate amount of the surplus funds of the Federal Reserve banks from $10 million to $7.5 million. Under current law, surplus funds that exceed or would exceed the limit must be deposited into the Treasury.  (Sec. 30206) The Department of Labor must award grants for states to conduct a program of reemployment services and eligibility assessments for certain individuals who receive unemployment compensation.  This section also amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 and the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to require discretionary spending limits, committee allocations, and budget aggregates to be adjusted, subject to specified limits, for legislation that appropriates more than $117 million for a fiscal year for the grants.  TITLE III--TEMPORARY EXTENSION OF PUBLIC DEBT LIMIT  (Sec. 30301) The public debt limit is suspended through March 1, 2019. On March 2, 2019, the limit is increased to accommodate obligations issued during the suspension period.  Adjustments to the debt limit for obligations during the suspension period are limited to obligations necessary to fund a commitment incurred by the federal government that required payment before March 2, 2019. The Department of the Treasury may not issue obligations during the suspension period to increase cash balances above normal operating balances.  TITLE IV--JOINT SELECT COMMITTEES  Subtitle A--Joint Select Committee on Solvency of Multiemployer Pension Plans  (Sec. 30422) This subtitle establishes a joint select committee of Congress to provide recommendations and legislative language that will significantly improve the solvency of multiemployer pension plans and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.  The joint committee terminates on December 31, 2018, or 30 days after submission of its report and legislative recommendations, whichever occurs first. (Sec. 30423) The Senate may allocate up to $500,000 from the special reserve within the Expenses of Inquiries and Investigations account for use by the joint committee. None of the funds provided by this section may be obligated by the joint committee after January 2, 2019.  (Sec. 30424) The Senate must consider legislation proposed by the joint committee using specified expedited legislative procedures.  Subtitle B--Joint Select Committee on Budget and Appropriations Process Reform  (Sec. 30442) This subtitle establishes a joint select committee of Congress to provide recommendations and legislative language that will significantly reform the budget and appropriations process.

An HVCRE ADC loan : (1) is secured by land or improved real property; (2) has the purpose of providing financing to acquire, develop, or improve the real property such that the property becomes income-producing; and (3) is dependent upon future income or sales proceeds from, or refinancing of, the real property for the repayment of the loan.  (Sec. 215) The Social Security Administration (SSA) is directed to develop a database to facilitate the verification of consumer information upon request by a certified financial institution.

It also: (1) requires a consumer reporting agency to provide a consumer with free credit freezes and to notify a consumer of their availability, (2) establishes provisions related to the placement and removal of these freezes, (3) creates requirements related to the protection of the credit records of minors.  (Sec. 302) The bill limits, and establishes  a dispute process and verification procedures with respect to, the inclusion of a veteran's medical debt in a consumer credit report.  (Sec. 303) The bill extends immunity from liability to certain individuals employed at financial institutions who, in good faith and with reasonable care, disclose the suspected exploitation of a senior citizen to a regulatory or law-enforcement agency. Similarly, the employing financial institution shall not be liable with respect to disclosures made by such employees.  The bill allows financial institutions and third-party entities to offer training related to the suspected financial exploitation of a senior citizen to specified employees. The bill provides guidance regarding the content, timing, and record-maintenance requirements of such training.  (Sec. 304) The sunset provision of the Protecting Tenants at Foreclosure Act is repealed, restoring notification requirements and other protections related to the eviction of renters in foreclosed properties. (The Act expired on December 31, 2014.) (Sec. 305) Treasury may use loan guarantees and credit enhancements to remediate lead and asbestos hazards in residential properties.  (Sec. 306) The bill amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to revise the Family-Self-Sufficiency (FSS) program, an employment and savings incentive program for families that reside in public housing or have housing vouchers. Specifically, the bill:   combines existing, separately operated FSS programs into a single program;  extends program eligibility to tenants of certain privately owned properties subsidized with project-based rental assistance;  revises program requirements related to eligibility, supportive services, and escrow deposits; and  otherwise modifies the FSS program.  (Sec. 307) The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is directed to promulgate ability-to-repay regulations regarding property assessed clean energy financing. (Sec. 308) The bill directs the GAO to report on the accuracy and security of consumer reporting agencies and consumer reports.  (Sec. 309) A refinanced home loan may not be guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), unless: (1) a specified minimum time period has passed between the original loan and the refinancing; and (2) the lender complies with provisions related to fee recoupment, mortgage interest rates, and net tangible benefit tests. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae) must report on the liquidity of the VA Housing Loan Program. The VA must report annually on refinanced home loans to veterans. (Sec. 310) The bill amends the Federal National Mortgage Association Charter Act and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Act to allow the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), when determining whether to purchase a residential mortgage, to consider a borrower's credit score only if certain procedural requirements are met with respect to the validation and approval of credit-scoring models. The Federal Housing Finance Agency must, by regulation, establish standards and criteria for processes used by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to validate and approve credit-scoring models in accordance with the bill. (Sec. 311) The GAO is directed to report on foreclosures, homeownership, and mortgage defaults in Puerto Rico before and after Hurricane Maria. (Sec. 312) HUD must report on and provide recommendations for lead-based paint hazard prevention and abatement, with an emphasis on preventing exposure in children. (Sec. 313) The bill amends the Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act of 2012 to make permanent the one-year grace period during which a servicemember is protected from foreclosure after leaving military service.  TITLE IV--TAILORING REGULATIONS FOR CERTAIN BANK HOLDING COMPANIES  (Sec. 401) The bill amends the Financial Stability Act of 2010, with respect to nonbank financial companies supervised by the FRB and certain bank holding companies, to:  increase the asset threshold at which certain enhanced prudential standards shall apply, from $50 billion to $250 billion, while allowing the FRB discretion in determining whether a financial institution with assets equal or greater than $100 billion must be subject to such standards;  increase the asset threshold at which company-run stress tests are required, from $10 billion to $250 billion; and  increase the asset threshold for mandatory risk committees, from $10 billion to $50 billion.  (Sec. 402) The bill requires the appropriate federal banking agencies to exclude, for purposes of calculating a custodial bank's supplementary leverage ratio, funds of a custodial bank that are deposited with a central bank. (""Supplementary leverage ratio"" is a capital adequacy measure that refers to the ratio of a banking organization's tier-one capital to its leverage exposure.) The amount of such funds may not exceed the total value of deposits of the custodial bank linked to fiduciary or custodial and safekeeping accounts.  (Sec. 403) This bill amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to require certain municipal obligations to be treated as level 2B liquid assets if they are investment grade, liquid, and readily marketable. Under current law, corporate debt securities and publicly traded common-equity shares, but not municipal obligations, may be treated as level 2B liquid assets (which are considered to be high-quality assets).  TITLE V--ENCOURAGING CAPITAL FORMATION  (Sec. 501) The bill amends the Securities Act of 1933 to exempt from state registration securities qualified for national trading by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and authorized to be listed on a national securities exchange. Currently, securities listed on exchanges specified by statute or SEC rule are exempt.  (Sec. 502) The bill directs the SEC to report on the risks and benefits of algorithmic trading in capital markets. (Sec. 504) The bill amends the Investment Company Act of 1940 to exempt from the definition of an ""investment company,"" for purposes of specified limitations applicable to such a company under the Act, a qualifying venture capital fund that has no more than 250 investors. Specifically, the bill applies to a venture capital fund that has less than $10 million in aggregate capital contributions and uncalled committed capital. Under current law, a venture capital fund is considered to be an investment company if it has more than 100 investors. (Sec. 505) The bill requires the SEC to offset future fees and assessments due from a national securities exchange or association that: (1) has previously overpaid such fees and assessments, and (2) informs the SEC of the overpayment within 10 years. (Sec. 506) The bill amends the Investment Company Act of 1940 to apply the Act to investment companies created under the laws of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, or any other U.S. possession. (Sec. 507) The bill requires the SEC to increase, from $5 million to $10 million, the 12-month sales threshold beyond which an issuer is required to provide investors with additional disclosures related to compensatory benefit plans. (Sec. 508) The bill expands the applicability to issuers of ""Regulation A+"" (which exempts certain smaller offerings from securities registration requirements). (Sec. 509) The bill directs the SEC to revise registration rules to allow a closed-end company to use offering and proxy rules currently available to other issuers of securities, thereby reducing filing requirements and restrictions on communications with investors in certain circumstances. (A closed-end company is a publicly traded investment management company that sells a limited number of shares to investors in an initial public offering.) TITLE VI--PROTECTIONS FOR STUDENT BORROWERS (Sec. 601) The bill amends TILA to prospectively revise provisions relating to cosigners of private student loans. Specifically, the bill: (1) prohibits a creditor from declaring a default or accelerating the debt of a private student loan on the sole basis of the death or bankruptcy of a cosigner to such a loan, and (2) directs loan holders to release cosigners from any obligation upon the death of the student borrower.  (Sec. 602) The bill amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to allow a person to request the removal of a previously reported default regarding a private education loan from a consumer report if: (1) the lender chooses to offer a loan-rehabilitation program that requires a number of consecutive on-time monthly payments demonstrating renewed ability and willingness to repay the loan, and (2) the consumer meets those requirements. A consumer may obtain such rehabilitation benefits only once per loan. The GAO shall report on the implementation of these provisions. (Sec. 603) The bill amends the Financial Literacy and Education Improvement Act to direct the Financial Literacy and Education Commission to establish best practices for teaching financial literacy skills at institutions of higher education.","Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act TITLE I--IMPROVING CONSUMER ACCESS TO MORTGAGE CREDIT  (Sec. 101) This bill amends the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) to allow a depository institution or credit union with assets below a specified threshold to forgo certain ability-to-pay requirements regarding residential mortgage loans. Specifically, those requirements are waived if a loan: (1) is originated by and retained by the institution, (2) complies with requirements regar..."

106,s109,A bill to prohibit taxpayer funded abortions.,"No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of 2019 This bill modifies provisions relating to federal funding for, and health insurance coverage of, abortions. Specifically, the bill prohibits the use of federal funds for abortions or for health coverage that includes abortions. Such restrictions extend to the use of funds in the budget of the District of Columbia. Additionally, abortions may not be provided in a federal health care facility or by a federal employee.  Historically, language has been included in annual appropriations bills for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that prohibits the use of federal funds for abortions—such language is commonly referred to as the Hyde Amendment. Similar language is also frequently included in appropriations bills for other federal agencies and the District of Columbia. The bill makes these restrictions permanent and extends the restrictions to all federal funds (rather than specific agencies).  The bill's restrictions regarding the use of federal funds do not apply in cases of rape, incest, or where a physical disorder, injury, or illness endangers a woman's life unless an abortion is performed. The Hyde Amendment provides the same exceptions. The bill also prohibits qualified health plans from including coverage for abortions. Currently, qualified health plans may cover abortion, but the portion of the premium attributable to abortion coverage is not eligible for subsidies.","No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of 2019 This bill modifies provisions relating to federal funding for, and health insurance coverage of, abortions.

158,hr3,"To establish a fair price negotiation program, protect the Medicare program from excessive price increases, and establish an out-of-pocket maximum for Medicare part D enrollees, and for other purposes.","Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act This bill establishes several programs and requirements relating to the prices of prescription drugs, health care coverage and costs, and public health.  TITLE I--LOWERING PRICES THROUGH FAIR DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION The bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to negotiate prices for certain drugs. (Under current law, HHS may not negotiate the prices of covered drugs under the Medicare prescription drug benefit.) Specifically, HHS must negotiate maximum prices for (1) insulin products; (2) with respect to FY2023, at least 25 single-source, brand-name drugs that do not have generic competition and that are among either the 125 drugs that account for the greatest national spending or the 125 drugs that account for the greatest spending under the Medicare prescription drug benefit and Medicare Advantage (MA); (3) beginning in FY2024, at least 50 such single-source, brand-name drugs; and (4) newly approved single-source, brand-name drugs that meet or exceed a specified price threshold and that HHS determines are likely to meet the spending criteria. The negotiated prices must be offered under Medicare and MA and may also be offered under private health insurance unless the insurer opts out.  The negotiated maximum price may not exceed (1) 120% of the average price in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom; or (2) if such information is not available, 85% of the U.S. average manufacturer price. Drug manufacturers that fail to comply with the bill's negotiation requirements are subject to civil and tax penalties. TITLE II--MEDICARE PARTS B AND D PRESCRIPTION DRUG INFLATION REBATES The bill also requires drug manufacturers, subject to civil penalties, to issue rebates to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) for covered drugs under Medicare that cost $100 or more and for which the average manufacturer price increases faster than inflation. TITLE III--PART D IMPROVEMENTS AND MAXIMUM OUT-OF-POCKET CAP FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES The bill reduces the annual out-of-pocket spending threshold, and eliminates beneficiary cost-sharing above this threshold, under the Medicare prescription drug benefit. Additionally, prescription drug plan sponsors must allow certain beneficiaries to make coinsurance payments in periodic installments, in accordance with CMS requirements. TITLE IV--DRUG PRICE TRANSPARENCY Drug manufacturers must report, subject to civil penalties, specified information for certain drugs that cost $100 or more and that are covered under Medicare or Medicaid, based on the rate of price or spending increases. Among other things, manufacturers must report a qualifying price increase at least 30 days before the effective date of the increase; HHS must publish the information on its website the day the increase takes effect. TITLE V--PROGRAM IMPROVEMENTS FOR MEDICARE LOW-INCOME BENEFICIARIES The bill expands eligibility for certain premium and cost-sharing subsidies for low-income beneficiaries under the Medicare prescription drug benefit. For example, the bill (1) raises the maximum allowable income for beneficiaries to qualify, and (2) allows certain residents of U.S. territories to automatically qualify. TITLE VI--PROVIDING FOR DENTAL, VISION, AND HEARING COVERAGE UNDER THE MEDICARE PROGRAM The bill also expands Medicare coverage to include (1) dentures and dental and oral health services, including basic and major treatments (as determined by the CMS) as well as specified preventive and screening services; (2) hearing aids and hearing rehabilitation and treatment services; and (3) eyeglasses, contact lenses, and vision services, including routine eye examinations and contact lens fittings. TITLE VII--NIH, FDA, AND OPIOIDS FUNDING The bill provides additional funds for several public health programs. Among other things, the bill (1) provides specified funds for innovation projects at the National Institutes of Health through FY2030 and for innovation projects at the Food and Drug Administration through FY2029; and (2) establishes the Opioid Epidemic Response Fund to support HHS programs and initiatives, including the State Opioid Response Grant Program. Additionally, HHS must take a series of actions relating to health care administrative costs. Specifically, HHS must develop a strategy and take associated action to reduce unnecessary costs and administrative burdens in the health care system, including Medicare, Medicaid, and the private health-insurance market, by at least half over a period of 10 years. HHS must also award grants so that states may establish commissions targeting such costs.  TITLE VIII--MISCELLANEOUS The bill also establishes and revises several other health care programs and requirements. For example, the bill (1) expands guaranteed issue rights with respect to Medigap policies (Medicare supplemental health-insurance policies); (2) provides specified funds for the Community Health Centers Fund through FY2025; (3) establishes grant programs to support mental health and trauma services in schools, as well as career development programs for health professionals; and (4) requires pass-through pricing models, and prohibits spread-pricing, for payment arrangements with pharmacy benefit managers under Medicaid.  Additionally, the CMS must issue regulations that require direct-to-consumer television advertisements for all covered drugs and biologics under Medicare and Medicaid to include the list price of a 30-day supply or for a typical course of treatment. (On May 10, 2019, the CMS issued a final rule titled Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Regulation to Require Drug Pricing Transparency. The rule requires direct-to-consumer television advertisements for covered drugs and biologics under Medicare and Medicaid to include the list price of a 30-day supply or for a typical course of treatment, if the list price is at least $35 per month.

These substances are man-made and may have adverse human health effects. A variety of products contain the compounds, such as nonstick cookware or weatherproof clothing. (Sec. 2) The bill designates certain PFAS as hazardous substances, thereby requiring remediation of releases of those PFAS into the environment. Within five years, the EPA must determine whether the remaining PFAS should be designated as hazardous substances, individually or in groups.  The bill exempts public agencies or private owners of public airports that receive federal funding from liability for remediation of certain releases of PFAS into the environment resulting from the use of aqueous film forming foam. (Sec. 3) The EPA must require that comprehensive toxicity testing be conducted on all PFAS. These rules shall require the development of information by any person who manufactures, processes, or intends to manufacture or process PFAS. The bill also provides guidelines for the development of these rules, including the methodologies and protocols to be used. The bill revises when any PFAS may be exempt from testing or information submission and requires the EPA to publish a list of all exempt PFAS. (Sec. 4) Currently, unless requirements for an exemption are met, persons planning to manufacture a chemical substance not listed on the EPA’s inventory list or manufacture or process a chemical substance for a significant new use must comply with certain notification requirements. The bill prohibits PFAS from being exempted from these requirements. For five years, the EPA shall prohibit the manufacture, processing, and distribution of PFAS not listed on the EPA’s inventory list or the manufacture or processing of PFAS for a significant new use. (Sec. 5) The bill requires the EPA to promulgate a national primary drinking water regulation for certain PFAS. The EPA must publish a health advisory for PFAS not subject to a national primary drinking water regulation. (Sec. 6) The bill prohibits the EPA from imposing financial penalties for the first five years for a violation of a national primary drinking water regulation with respect to PFAS. (Sec. 7) The EPA must establish a grant program to assist community water systems with the costs associated with treating water contaminated by PFAS. (Sec. 8) In relation to the regulation of toxic air pollutants, the EPA must (1) issue a final rule adding certain PFAS to the list of hazardous air pollutants, and (2) revise the list of air pollution sources within 365 days after issuing the rule to include categories and subcategories of major sources and area sources of PFAS. Within five years, the EPA must determine whether to issue a final rule adding the remaining PFAS to the list of hazardous air pollutants. (Sec. 9) The EPA must regulate the disposal procedures for materials containing PFAS or aqueous film forming foam. For criminal penalty purposes, materials containing PFAS shall be considered hazardous waste. (Sec. 10) The bill requires the EPA to (1) revise the Safer Choice Standard of the Safer Choice Program to identify the requirements that specified products (e.g., cooking utensils) must meet in order to be labeled with a Safer Choice label, including a requirement that any such product does not contain PFAS; or (2) establish a voluntary label available for use by any manufacturer of any specified product that the EPA has reviewed and found does not contain any PFAS. The Safer Choice Program helps consumers and businesses find products with safer chemical ingredients through Safer Choice labels. (Sec. 11) The EPA must issue guidance on minimizing the use by first responders of firefighting foam and other related equipment containing any PFAS, without jeopardizing firefighting efforts. (Sec. 12) The EPA must investigate methods to prevent contamination by specified PFAS of surface waters, including those used for drinking water.  (Sec. 13) The bill requires an owner or operator of an industrial source that introduces PFAS into treatment works (systems that treat municipal sewage or industrial wastes) to provide specified notices to such treatment works, including the identity and quantity of such PFAS.  (Sec. 14) The EPA must establish a website containing specified information relating to the testing of household well water, including a list of certified laboratories that analyze samples. (Sec. 15) The EPA must develop a risk-communication strategy to inform the public about the hazards of PFAS. (Sec. 16) The bill authorizes the drinking water state revolving fund program to provide assistance to the Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, and Guam to address emerging contaminants, with a focus on PFAS. (Sec. 17) Finally, based on results of biennial reviews related to the discharge of PFAS from point sources that are not publicly owned treatment works, the EPA shall, for certain measureable PFAS, add the PFAS to the list of toxic pollutants, or establish effluent limitations and pretreatment standards.

The bill (1) permits a complaining party to rely on any type or form of admissible evidence, which need only be sufficient for a reasonable trier of fact to find that an unlawful practice occurred; and (2) declares that a complaining party shall not be required to demonstrate that age or retaliation was the sole cause of the employment practice (thereby rejecting the Supreme Court's decision in Gross v.

TITLE VI—RESTRICTIONS ON CREDIT CHECKS FOR EMPLOYMENT DECISIONS A credit reporting agency is prohibited from providing a consumer's credit information for employment purposes, unless the information is for a national security investigation, for a background check or investigation required by regulation, or otherwise required by law. TITLE VII—PROHIBITION ON MISLEADING AND UNFAIR CONSUMER REPORTING PRACTICES The bill prohibits automatic renewals for promotional consumer credit products and services, allows the CFPB to set maximum fees for products and services offered by credit reporting agencies, and allows for multiple credit inquiries of the same type without penalty to a consumer's credit score.  Additionally, the bill directs the CFPB to issue rules to provide for   access to consumer reporting information for nonnative English speakers, the visually impaired, and the hearing impaired; and  the registration of credit reporting agencies.   The bill also establishes credit protections for consumers affected by a government shutdown. TITLE VIII—PROTECTIONS AGAINST IDENTITY THEFT, FRAUD, OR A RELATED CRIME The bill revises fraud alert protections to allow for an extension of these protections upon request of the consumer if the threat of fraud is ongoing. The bill also requires a credit reporting agency to provide free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services to victims of fraud, the unemployed, recipients of public assistance, active duty uniformed consumer, and those 65 years of age and older.  The bill expands to victims of fraud existing consumer protections applicable to victims of identity theft, including free credit scores, additional free credit reports, and access to records of fraudulent activity.

Such waivers must be requested by a state or service provider and be for purposes of providing meals and snacks during such a closure. TITLE II--COVID-19 CHILD NUTRITION RESPONSE ACT COVID-19 Child Nutrition Response Act (Sec. 2202) This section authorizes USDA to  issue a single waiver of child nutrition program requirements to all states under the National School Lunch Program for purposes of providing meals and snacks with appropriate safety measures with respect to COVID-19, grant waivers of requirements to allow non-congregate feeding in the Child and Adult Care Food Program for purposes of providing meals and snacks with appropriate safety measures with respect to COVID-19, and grant waivers related to the nutritional content of meals served in child nutrition programs if it determines the waiver is necessary to provide meals and snacks and there is a food supply chain disruption due to COVID-19.  (Sec. 2203) USDA may  grant waivers allowing participants under the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) to get certified or recertified without being physically present at a WIC clinic, and defer anthropometric and bloodwork requirements necessary to determine nutritional risk.  State agencies must submit waiver requests to USDA. (Sec. 2204) USDA may also grant waivers from administrative requirements for WIC if it determines that (1) the requirement cannot be met by a state due to COVID-19, and (2) the waiver is necessary to provide assistance under WIC.

Specifically, employers of fewer than 500 workers must provide up to 12 weeks paid leave for an employee who cannot work because the school or child-care provider of that employee's child is closed as a result of a public-health emergency.  Employers are not required to pay employees for the first 10 days of such public health emergency leave. However, an employee may use accrued paid leave during such time. After the first 10 days, employers must pay not less than two-thirds of an employee's regular pay for the number of hours per week the employee normally works. The maximum amount of compensation for such leave is $200 per day and $10,000 in aggregate.  Further, employers are generally required to restore an employee's former position following the use of public health emergency leave unless, the employer (1) has fewer than 25 workers and (2) has made reasonable efforts to retain the employee's position but such position no longer exists due to economic conditions caused by such public health emergency.  With a finding of good cause, the Department of Labor may (1) exclude certain health care providers and emergency responders from eligibility for public health emergency leave, and (2) exempt employers with fewer than 50 employees if the requirements of this section would place the viability of that business at risk.  (Sec. 3103) Employers subject to multiemployer bargaining agreements may make contributions to a multiemployer fund to fulfill the employer's obligations under this division and employees may secure compensation from such fund for leave taken subject to this division.  (Sec. 3104) Employers with fewer than 50 employees for each working day during each of at least 20 workweeks during the preceding year are not subject to civil liability for a violation of this division.

The amount of available funds for each state is based on the Department of Labor's determination of the proportion of the total taxable wages attributable to a state during the preceding year. Each state receives 50% of such determined amount if the state  requires employers to notify employees about the availability of unemployment compensation at the time the employee separates from an employer; ensures that unemployment applications are available through at least two of three methods: in-person, by phone, or online; and provides assistance with processing unemployment applications.   Additionally, a state receives the remaining 50% of such funds if, among other requirements  the number of unemployment claims in the state has increased by at least 10% compared with the same quarter during the previous year; and the state demonstrates policies to increase access to unemployment compensation such as waiving the requirement to search for work and the one-week waiting period to receive benefits, among others.  (Sec. 4103) This section suspends the accrual of interest through December 31, 2020, on federal payments made to states for assistance with unemployment compensation.  (Sec. 4104) Labor must assist states in raising public awareness about available short-time compensation programs and provide technical assistance and guidance for such programs.  (Sec. 4105) This section increases to 100% the federal share of payments to states for extended and regular unemployment compensation through December 31, 2020.  DIVISION E--EMERGENCY PAID SICK LEAVE ACT  Emergency Paid Sick Leave Act  (Sec. 5102) This section requires employers to provide paid sick time to employees who are unable to work due to the effects of COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019). Specifically, full-time employees are entitled to 80 hours of paid sick time, which is available immediately, for use if the employee  is subject to a governmental quarantine or isolation order, has been advised by a health-care provider to self-quarantine, is caring for an individual who is subject to governmental or self-quarantine, is caring for the employee's child because the child's school or child-care provider is closed, or is experiencing a substantially similar circumstance related to COVID-19 as specified by the Department of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Department of Labor.  Paid sick time under this section may be used before other paid leave that may be available to an employee. Part-time employees are entitled to such paid sick time for the average number of hours the part-time employee works during an average two-week period. Paid sick time under this section may not carry over from one year to the next.  (Sec. 5103) Employers must provide conspicuous notice in the workplace of the emergency paid sick time requirements under this division and Labor must provide publicly-available models of such notice not later than seven days after the enactment of this division.  (Sec. 5104) Employers are prohibited from taking adverse actions against employees who take leave under this division or take actions to enforce the requirements of this division.

(Sec. 5107) This division does not affect employer rights or benefits under any other law, collective bargaining agreement, or existing employer policy. Employers are not required to pay employees for unused emergency paid sick time if an employee resigns, retires, or is terminated.  (Sec. 5108) The emergency paid sick time requirements take effect not later than 15 days after the enactment of this division.  (Sec. 5109) The emergency paid sick time requirements expire on December 31, 2020.  (Sec. 5110) Employers with fewer than 500 employees and federal, state, and local public agencies are subject to the requirements of this division. Employers must pay the regular rate of pay up to  $511 per day, and $5,110 in aggregate, for paid sick time used by an employee who experiences symptoms of COVID-19 or is required or advised to self-quarantine; or $200 per day, and $2,000 in aggregate, for paid sick time used by an employee to care for the employee's child or other impacted person.  (Sec. 5111) With a finding of good cause, Labor may (1) exclude certain health care providers and emergency responders from eligibility for emergency paid sick leave, and (2) exempt employers with fewer than 50 employees if the requirements of this division would place the viability of that business at risk. DIVISION F--HEALTH PROVISIONS (Sec. 6001) This section requires private health insurance to cover testing for COVID-19 without imposing cost-sharing (e.g., deductibles, coinsurance, or copayments) for the duration of the public health emergency declared on January 31, 2020.

(Emergency use authorizations allow for the use of unapproved drugs, biological products, or devices, or for the unapproved use of such products, to respond to a declared emergency.) (Sec. 6006) During the emergency period, the Department of Defense (i.e., TRICARE) and Department of Veterans Affairs are also prohibited from requiring cost-sharing for COVID-19 testing and related visits. Additionally, individuals in civil service (i.e., all appointive positions in the executive, judicial, and legislative branches, excluding the uniformed services) who are enrolled in a health benefits plan shall not be subject to cost-sharing requirements for such services. (Sec. 6007) This section requires the Department of Health and Human Services to cover, during the public health emergency and without cost-sharing, COVID-19 testing and related visits for Native Americans, including Alaska Natives, who receive health services through the Indian Health Service (IHS), regardless of whether the COVID-19 services are covered under IHS. (Sec. 6008) This section increases the Medicaid FMAP for all states and U.S. territories during the public health emergency, in accordance with specified conditions.

Subtitle B--Rebates and Other Individual Provisions This subtitle allows individual taxpayers below a certain income level and their dependent children a one-time refundable tax credit and other tax benefits to compensate for financial losses due to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019). (Sec. 2201) This section allows individual taxpayers a refundable income tax credit of $1,200 ($2,400 for married couples filing a joint return). A $500 credit is allowed for each qualifying child of the taxpayer. The credit is eliminated for taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes exceeding $75,000 ($150,000 for joint returns). To be eligible for the credit, taxpayers must include valid identification numbers (e.g., Social Security numbers) on their tax returns. The Department of the Treasury must conduct a public awareness campaign regarding the availability of the credit. (Sec. 2202) This section permits penalty-free coronavirus-related distributions from tax-exempt retirement plans up to $100,000 in a taxable year. A coronavirus-related distribution is defined as any distributions from an eligible retirement plan made on or after January 1, 2020, and before December 31, 2020, to an individual who is (1) diagnosed with the virus SARS-CoV-2, (2) whose spouse or dependent is diagnosed with such virus or disease, or (3) who experienced adverse financial consequences from being quarantined, furloughed, or laid off from work due to such virus or disease.

TITLE III--SUPPORTING AMERICA'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN THE FIGHT AGAINST THE CORONAVIRUS Subtitle A--Health Provisions Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act PART I--ADDRESSING SUPPLY SHORTAGES Subpart A--Medical Product Supplies (Sec. 3101) The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) must enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to report on the security of the U.S. medical product supply chain. (Sec. 3102) The strategic national stockpile must include personal protective equipment and supplies required for the administration of drugs, vaccines, biological products, medical devices, and diagnostic tests. (Sec. 3103) This section revises targeted liability protections with respect to certain claims arising from the use of a respiratory protective device (i.e., mask) approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Such protections shall apply if HHS declares such a device to be a priority for use during a declared public health emergency. Subpart B--Mitigating Emergency Drug Shortages (Sec. 3111) If notified by a manufacturer of a likely disruption in the supply of a medicine, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must, as appropriate (1) prioritize and expedite an application review to help mitigate or prevent a drug shortage, or (2) prioritize and expedite an inspection or reinspection of an establishment that could help mitigate or prevent a drug shortage. (Sec. 3112) This section expands reporting requirements for manufacturers with respect to drug shortages and requires such manufacturers to develop risk-management plans. The FDA must periodically transmit a report of shortage drugs to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services. If an FDA inspection reveals that a drug or product under shortage or interruption may have become contaminated, a report must be sent to relevant FDA personnel with drug-shortage expertise. Subpart C--Preventing Medical Device Shortages (Sec. 3121) The manufacturer of a device critical to public health during a public health emergency shall notify the FDA of an interruption or permanent discontinuance. If the FDA finds the existence of a shortage or likely shortage, it must prioritize and expedite (1) a device application review that could mitigate or prevent a shortage, or (2) an inspection or reinspection of an establishment that could mitigate or prevent a shortage. PART II--ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE FOR COVID-19 PATIENTS Subpart A--Coverage of Testing and Preventive Services (Sec. 3201) This section expands the scope of available diagnostic testing for COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) that private health insurance plans must cover. Specifically, it requires coverage of tests that have not been approved by the FDA if   the developer of such a test requests, or intends to request, emergency use authorization, unless such request is denied or is not submitted within a reasonable time; the test is developed and authorized in a state that has notified HHS that the state intends to review such tests; or HHS has issued guidance that such test is appropriate.  (Sec. 3202) This section specifies the process for private health insurance plan issuers to reimburse providers of COVID-19 diagnostic tests. Specifically, a reimbursement rate negotiated for such test prior to the public health emergency declared on January 31, 2020, continues to apply for the duration of the emergency. If a reimbursement rate was not negotiated prior to the emergency declaration, an issuer may either negotiate such rate or pay the provider's cash price. Additionally, test providers must publish the cash price of tests on their websites; HHS may assess a civil penalty for violations of this requirement. (Sec. 3203) This section shortens the time frame under which private health-insurance plans must cover certain new preventative services related to COVID-19. Under current law, health plans have one year to cover services recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force or the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Under this section, health plans must cover such services to prevent or diagnose COVID-19 within 15 days. Subpart B--Support for Health Care Providers (Sec. 3211) This section provides for additional funding to health centers that serve medically underserved populations for evidence-based models that increase access to high-quality primary-care services for purposes of (1) the detection of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19; or (2) the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of that disease. (Sec. 3212) This section reauthorizes through FY2025 and otherwise modifies grants for telehealth networks and telehealth resource centers that serve medically underserved populations. Among other changes, the bill (1) provides statutory authority for including substance-use disorder providers in the list of entities that may participate in telehealth networks, and (2) specifies a preference for applicants with a record of success in expanding telehealth in rural areas for telehealth resource services grants. (Sec. 3213) This section reauthorizes through FY2025 and otherwise modifies grant programs for rural health services outreach, rural health network development, and small health care provider quality improvement. Among other changes, the bill expands eligibility for certain grants to include entities that are not nonprofits. (Sec. 3214) This section allows for the deployment of the Ready Reserve Corps of the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps (Commissioned Corps) to serve in public health emergencies. Certain provisions related to compensation and leave without authority that apply to the Armed Forces shall also apply to officers of the Commissioned Corps or their beneficiaries. (Sec. 3215) This section extends liability protection for harm caused by acts or omissions by volunteer health care professionals in the course of providing certain health care services relating to COVID-19 during the public health emergency, in accordance with specified limitations. (Sec. 3216) This section authorizes the reassignment of members of the National Health Service Corps to provide health care services at alternative sites in response to the public health emergency, subject to the voluntary agreement of the corps members and other specified restrictions. Subpart C--Miscellaneous Provisions (Sec. 3221) This section more closely aligns the federal privacy standards applicable to substance-use disorder patient records with the relevant privacy and de-identification standards applicable to other records that contain personal health information for the purposes of (1) treatment, payment, and health care operations by health plans, providers, or clearinghouses; and (2) disclosures to public health authorities. The section requires patients to give affirmative, written consent; once given, that consent applies to future disclosures. Such consent may be revoked by written request.  The section also (1) aligns criminal penalties for certain violations involving substance-use disorder patient records with the penalties that apply to violations involving other types of records containing personal health information; (2) expands the current prohibition against using substance-use disorder patient records in criminal proceedings to include any use in specified federal, state, and local criminal and civil actions; and (3) prohibits certain discrimination based on the release of such patient records with respect to access to treatment, employment, housing, and certain social services and benefits (Sec. 3222) This section allows a state agency or area agency on aging to transfer funds between congregate and home-delivered nutrition services programs for older adults without prior approval to meet the needs of the state or area served during the public health emergency. The section also (1) expands eligibility for home-delivered meals to include those who are unable to obtain nutrition because they are practicing social distancing, and (2) permits the Administration on Aging to waive certain nutrition requirements for meals provided through the nutrition services for older adults during the emergency. (Sec. 3223) This section permits the Department of Labor, in response to the effects of the public health emergency, to increase the length of time individuals may participate in, and the amount available to pay authorized administrative costs for, Community Service Employment Program projects for older adults. (Sec. 3224) This section directs HHS to issue guidance within 180 days on the sharing of protected health information during specified emergency declarations with respect to COVID-19.  (Sec. 3225) This section reauthorizes through FY2025 and otherwise makes changes to the Healthy Start for Infants initiative, which focuses on reducing infant mortality and improving perinatal outcomes. Among other changes, the bill requires HHS to consider additional factors, such as data collection and evaluation methods, when awarding grants. In addition, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) must conduct an independent evaluation of the program. (Sec. 3226) HHS must carry out a national public awareness campaign in consultation with relevant federal agencies and other stakeholders on blood donations and the need for donations for the blood supply during the public health emergency. PART III--INNOVATION (Sec. 3301) This section eliminates the requirement for a specified written determination for the use of other transaction authority (OTA) for projects expected to cost in excess of $100 million during certain public health emergencies. (OTA allows the Biomedical Research and Development Authority to enter into certain other transactions that are generally exempt from the federal procurement laws and regulations that apply to contracts, grants and cooperative agreements.) Such transactions shall not be terminated solely due to the expiration of such a public health emergency. (Sec. 3302) The FDA must expedite the review of a new animal drug if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug, alone or in combination, may prevent or treat a serious zoonotic disease (i.e., a disease that can be spread from animals to humans).  PART IV--HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE (Sec. 3401) This section reauthorizes through FY2025 and otherwise makes changes to specified education and training programs concerning the health professions workforce, including (1) centers related to workforce analysis and health professions education, and (2) certain loan-repayment and other educational assistance programs for specified health professionals. (Sec. 3402) HHS must develop a plan with respect to health care workforce development programs in consultation with specified stakeholders. Among other topics, the plan must include performance measures and identify gaps between the outcomes of such workforce programs and certain workforce projection reports. (Sec. 3403) This section reauthorizes through FY2025 and otherwise modifies education and training programs related to the geriatric workforce. Among other changes, the section (1) provides specific statutory authority for the Geriatrics Workforce Enhancement Program, which provides grants to health professions schools and other approved programs in order to improve health care for older adults and maximize patient and family engagement; and (2) revises application, reporting, and other requirements for the Geriatric Academic Career Awards, which promote career development for certain academic geriatricians or other geriatric health professionals in academic settings.  (Sec. 3404) This section reauthorizes through FY2025 and otherwise modifies nursing workforce education and training programs.

Subtitle B--Education Provisions COVID-19 Pandemic Education Relief Act of 2020 (Sec. 3503) The Department of Education (ED) must waive the requirement, for award years 2019-2020 and 2020-2021, that institutions of higher education (IHEs) provide matching funds under the Federal Work-Study and Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant programs. During a qualifying emergency, IHEs may transfer their unexpended allotments from the Federal Work-Study program to their allotments for the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant program. (Sec. 3504) IHEs may reserve Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant funds to award emergency financial-aid grants to undergraduate or graduate students for unexpected expenses and unmet financial needs caused by a qualifying emergency.

An IHE may provide a student with an approved leave of absence that does not require the student to return at the same point in the academic program if the student returns within the same semester. (Sec. 3509) IHEs may exclude attempted credits that were not completed as a result of a qualifying emergency from the qualitative component of the satisfactory academic progress calculation without requiring an appeal by the student. (Sec. 3510) This section authorizes ED to permit foreign IHEs to offer distance education during an emergency.  ED may allow foreign IHEs, for financial-aid purposes, to enter into certain written arrangements with IHEs located in the United States. (Sec. 3511) ED may waive certain statutory or regulatory requirements for state educational agencies, local educational agencies, and Indian tribes. ED may not waive any statutory or regulatory requirements under applicable civil rights laws. (Sec. 3512) ED may grant a deferment to a historically black college or university (HBCU) that has received a loan for capital financing. This section provides funds for ED to make principal and interest payments during the deferment period. At the closing of such a loan, the HBCU must repay ED for the payments of principal and interest made by ED during the deferment. (Sec. 3513) This section requires ED to suspend all payments due on Federal Direct Loans and Federal Family Education Loans held by ED through September 30, 2020. Interest shall not accrue on such loans. Additionally, ED must  deem each month for which a loan payment was suspended as if the borrower of the loan had made a payment for the purpose of any loan forgiveness program or loan rehabilitation program authorized under the Federal Direct Loan or Federal Family Education Loan programs; ensure that any suspended payment on such loan is treated as a regularly scheduled payment made by a borrower for the purpose of reporting information about the loan to a consumer reporting agency; suspend all involuntary collections related to such loans, including wage garnishments, reductions of tax refunds, and reductions of certain federal benefit payments, such as Social Security; notify borrowers, within 15 days, that their loan payments have been suspended and interest has been waived; and  carry out a program, beginning on August 1, 2020, to provide at least six notices to borrowers that normal payment obligations will resume.   (Sec. 3514) The Corporation for National and Community Service must allow an individual who is performing limited service due to COVID-19, or whose position was suspended or placed on hold due to COVID-19, to accrue other service hours that will count toward the number of hours needed for the individual's education award.

Subtitle F--Over-The-Counter Drugs PART I--OTC DRUG REVIEW This subtitle makes significant changes to the regulation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of nonprescription (i.e., over-the-counter or OTC) drugs, which typically includes products found in the drugstore aisle, such as antacids, pain relievers, and cough and cold medicines. (Sec. 3851) This part establishes a new approval process for OTC medications. Specifically, it creates an FDA administrative order process for the evaluation of OTC products, replacing the present notice and comment rulemaking approach. Under the new process, the FDA may issue an administrative order determining a specific OTC drug, class of drugs, or combination is generally regarded as safe and effective and not subject to the new drug application process. The FDA may also use the administrative order process to (1) determine a drug, class of drugs, or combination pose an imminent hazard to the public health; or (2) require labeling changes to mitigate a significant or unreasonable risk of a serious adverse event associated with use of the drug. The bill provides for market exclusivity under certain circumstances. For drugs determined to be generally regarded as safe and effective pursuant to an administrative order requested by a sponsor (rather than initiated by the FDA), the requestor is granted 18 months of market exclusivity. This market exclusivity applies to an OTC drug with a new active ingredient or where the requestor conducted new human studies to get approval. The Government Accountability Office must review the impact of granting market exclusivity to such OTC sponsors, including the impact on innovation. (Sec. 3852) OTC drugs that do not comply with the requirements in this part are deemed misbranded (i.e., improperly labeled). (Sec. 3853) The new requirements do not apply to any OTC product that was marketed in the United States before May 11, 1972. (Sec. 3854) This section allows a sponsor of a nonprescription sunscreen active ingredient or a combination of such ingredients that was subject to a proposed sunscreen order to transition to the administrative order process. Market exclusivity provisions also apply to new sunscreen active ingredients. (Sec. 3855) The FDA must report on its progress updating the monograph for cough and cold medicines with respect to children under the age of six. (Sec. 3856) The section makes technical corrections related to the new OTC requirements. PART II--USER FEES (Sec. 3862) This part establishes a user fee program for OTC drugs under which the FDA must assess user fees on persons who own an OTC facility or who request an administrative order for an OTC drug. TITLE IV--ECONOMIC STABILIZATION AND ASSISTANCE TO SEVERELY DISTRESSED SECTORS OF THE UNITED STATES ECONOMY Subtitle A--Coronavirus Economic Stabilization Act of 2020 Coronavirus Economic Stabilization Act of 2020 (Sec. 4003) This section authorizes the Department of the Treasury to make loans, loan guarantees, and other investments in support of eligible businesses, states, and municipalities. Such funds shall be made available for (1) passenger air carriers, ticket agents, and aircraft repair stations; (2) cargo air carriers; (3) businesses critical to maintaining national security; and (4) programs or facilities established by the Federal Reserve Board for the purpose of providing liquidity to the financial system that supports lending to eligible businesses, states, or municipalities.  Treasury may not issue a loan to, or a loan guarantee for, an eligible business unless Treasury receives a warrant or equity interest in the eligible business or a senior debt instrument issued by the business. A loan or guarantee recipient is prohibited from paying dividends or repurchasing stock while the loan or guarantee is outstanding or for 12 months following repayment. Furthermore, a recipient may not reduce its employment levels by more than 10% from its levels as of March 24, 2020.  The section directs Treasury to endeavor to establish a program to provide low-interest loans for mid-sized businesses (businesses with between 500 and 10,000 employees). Treasury may not require repayment of such loans for at least six months.  Treasury may designate financial institutions as financial agents of the United States and require them to perform all reasonable duties necessary to respond to the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) outbreak.  Any loan made or guaranteed by Treasury pursuant to this subtitle shall be treated as indebtedness for tax purposes.  (Sec. 4004) This section limits the maximum allowable compensation of an officer or employee of a business that receives a loan or a loan guarantee from Treasury under this subtitle.  (Sec. 4005) The Department of Transportation (DOT) may temporarily require an air carrier receiving such a loan or loan guarantee to maintain scheduled air transportation service deemed necessary to ensure services to any point served by that carrier prior to March 1, 2020.  (Sec. 4006) This section requires Treasury to coordinate with DOT in implementing this subtitle with respect to air carriers.  (Sec. 4007) This section suspends the imposition of certain aviation excise taxes until January 1, 2021. (Sec. 4008) The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may establish a temporary debt guarantee program for solvent insured depository institutions and solvent depository institution holding companies. The National Credit Union Administration may temporarily increase the share insurance coverage on any non-interest-bearing transaction account in any federally insured credit union.
